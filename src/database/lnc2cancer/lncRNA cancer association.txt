We also found that inhibition of AATBC resulted in cell proliferation arrest through G1 cell cycle mediated by cyclin D1, CDK4, p18 and phosphorylated Rb. In addition, inhibition of AATBC induced cell apoptosis through the intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway, as evidenced by the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. The investigation for the signaling pathway revealed that the apoptosis following AATBC knockdown was mediated by activation of phosphorylated JNK and suppression of NRF2. 	25473900	2014	Knockdown of a novel LincRNA AATBC suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis in bladder cancer.

Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that increased AB073614 expression contributed to poor overall survival (HR (hazard ratio) = 1.952, 95%CI: 1.202-3.940, p = 0.0129).

Finally, after adjustment with age, sex, tumor grade and tumor location, multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that both highly expressed lncRNA AB073614 (HR = 2.606, 95%CI: 1.408-4.824, p = 0.002) and high tumor grade (III-IV grades, HR = 2.720, 95%CI: 1.401-5.282, p = 0.003) could be considered independent poor prognostic indicators for glioma patients	27104549	2016	Up-Regulation of Long Non-Coding RNA AB073614 Predicts a Poor Prognosis in Patients with Glioma

In addition, patients with decreased expression of AB209630 had a significantly poorer prognosis than those with high AB209630 expression. These data suggest that increased expression of AB209630 might either stimulate or inhibit biological activities involved in HSCC development, indicating a potential application of AB209630 in future treatment for this disease. This study suggest that AB209630 functions as a tumor suppressor in HSCC, and its decreased expression may help predict a poor prognostic outcome of HSCC.

In vitro loss- and gain-of-function assays revealed that AGAP2-AS1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and induced cell apoptosis. In vivo assays also confirmed the ability of AGAP2-AS1 to promote tumor growth. Furthermore, mechanistic investigation showed that AGAP2-AS1 could bind with enhancer of zeste homolog 2 and lysine (K)-specific demethylase 1A, and recruit them to KLF2 and LATS2 promoter regions to repress their transcription.

Additionally, reduced BANCR expression was associated with larger tumor size, advanced pathological stage, metastasis distance, and shorter overall survival of NSCLC patients. Reduced BANCR expression was found to be an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC. Histone deacetylation was involved in the downregulation of BANCR in NSCLC cells. Ectopic expression of BANCR impaired cell viability and invasion, leading to the inhibition of metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of BANCR was found to play a key role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the regulation of E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin expression.	24655544	2014	Downregulation of BRAF activated non-coding RNA is associated with poor prognosis for non-small cell lung cancer and promotes metastasis by affecting epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

In the SKOV3 and A2780 cells, BC200 exerted no effect on invasive or migratory ability, however, the inhibition of BC200 was demonstrated to promote cell proliferation. Additionally, it was observed that carboplatin induced BC200 expression in the cell lines, and that the inhibition of BC200 decreased the sensitivity of the cells to the drug. BC200 is therefore likely to have a tumor suppressive function in ovarian cancer by affecting cell proliferation. Furthermore, BC200 appears to serve a role in the mediation of carboplatin-induced ovarian cancer cell death	26893717	2016	Downregulation of BC200 in ovarian cancer contributes to cancer cell proliferation and chemoresistance to carboplatin

Also in our BCAR4-expressing cell models, the combination of lapatinib and antioestrogens was more potent in inhibiting cell growth than lapatinib alone; indicating that blocking the ERBB2 pathway with lapatinib re-sensitises BCAR4-expressing cells to antioestrogens. BCAR4 expression strongly sensitised ZR-75-1 and MCF7 breast cancer cells to the combination of lapatinib and antioestrogens.	22892392	2012	BCAR4 induces antioestrogen resistance but sensitises breast cancer to lapatinib.

Inhibition of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) expression with small interfering RNA (siRNA), implied that the BCAR4-induced mechanism of resistance is independent of ESR1. BCAR4 is a strong transforming gene causing estrogen-independent growth and antiestrogen resistance, and induces tumor formation in vivo.

Further functional experiments indicate that CASC2 could directly upregulate PIAS3 expression by functioning as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-18a.

By gain- and loss-of-function analysis, we determined that CCAT1 repressed monocytic differentiation and promoted cell growth of HL-60 by sequestering tumor suppressive miR-155. Accordingly, a significant decrease in miR-155 level was detected in AML patients. Re-introduction of miR-155 into HL-60 cells restored monocytic maturation and repressed cell proliferation. Furthermore, CCAT1 could up-regulated c-Myc via its competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) activity on miR-155.

Importantly, CCAT1 contains a putative miR-490-binding site, and deletion of this binding site abolishes their miR-490 responsiveness. Post-transcriptional CCAT1 silencing by miR-490 significantly suppressed GC cell migration. Furthermore, miR-490 directly bound to the hnRNPA1 mRNA 3'-UTR to repress its translation. Inhibition of miR-490 rescued CCAT1 siRNA-mediated suppression of cell migration. hnRNPA1 expression was significantly upregulated in GC specimens, and there was a negative correlation between miR-490 and hnRNPA1 expression and also a positive correlation between hnRNAP1 expression level and CCAT1 level	26825578	2016	The long noncoding RNA colon cancer-associated transcript-1/miR-490 axis regulates gastric cancer cell migration by targeting hnRNPA1

Uptake of TO-PNA-MBs into cells was achieved by covalently attaching cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) to the TO-PNA-MB probes. In situ hybridization of selected TO-PNA-MB in human CRC specimens was shown to detect CCAT1 expression in all (4/4) subjects with pre-cancerous adenomas, and in all (8/8) patients with invasive adenocarcinoma (penetrating the bowel wall) tumors. The results showed that CCAT1 TO-PNA-MB is a powerful diagnostic tool for the specific identification of CRC, suggesting that with the aid of an appropriate pharmaceutical vehicle, real time in vivo imaging is feasible.	23416875	2014	Detection of a long non-coding RNA (CCAT1) in living cells and human adenocarcinoma of colon tissues using FIT-PNA molecular beacons.

Moreover, the levels of lincRNA-p21 (P < 0.05) were obviously decreased in plasma of CRC patients as compared to those of healthy control. There was highly correlated for CCAT1 (R = 0.752, mean differences = -0.06 ± 1.20), HOTAIR (R = 0.739, mean differences = -0.26 ± 0.76) and lincRNA-p21 (R = 0.848, mean differences = -0.41 ± 0.89) in plasma and serum. By receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, plasma CCAT1 provided the higher diagnostic performance for detection of CRC (the area under the ROC curve (AUC), 0.836; P < 0.001; sensitivity, 75.7%; specificity, 85.3%). Moreover, CCAT1 combining with HOTAIR could provide a more effective diagnosis performance (AUC, 0.954, P < 0.001, sensitivity, 84.3%; specificity, 80.2%). Most importantly, this combination was effective to detect CRC at an early stage (85%). In conclusion, our results demonstrated that increased plasma HOTAIR and CCAT1 could be used as a predictive biomarker for CRC screening, and that combination of HOTAIR and CCAT1 had a higher positive diagnostic rate of CRC than HOTAIR or CCAT1 alone	26823726	2016	Combined identification of long non-coding RNA CCAT1 and HOTAIR in serum as an effective screening for colorectal carcinoma

CRNDE overexpression facilitated cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while inhibited glioma cells apoptosis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demonstrated that miR-384 was downregulated in human glioma tissues and glioma cell lines. Moreover, restoration of miR-384 exerted tumor-suppressive functions. In addition, the expression of miR-384 was negatively correlated with CRNDE expression. A binding region between CRNDE and miR-384 was confirmed using luciferase assays. Moreover, CRNDE promoted cell malignant behavior by decreasing miR-384 expression. At the molecular level, treatment by CRNDE knockdown or miR-384 overexpression resulted in a decrease of piwi-like RNA-mediated gene silencing 4 (PIWIL4) protein. Besides, PIWIL4 was identified as a target of miR-384 and plays an oncogenic role in glioma. Similarly, downstream proteins of PIWIL4 such as STAT3, cyclin D1, VEGFA, SLUG, MMP-9, caspase 3, Bcl-2, and bcl-xL were modulated when treated with miR-384 and PIWIL4.

Overexpression of DBH-AS1 induced cell cycle progression by accelerating G1/S and G2/M transition concomitantly with upregulation of CDK6, CCND1, CCNE1 and downregulation of p16, p21 and p27. We also provide evidence that DBH-AS1 could be significantly induced by HBx protein and markedly down-regulated by p53. Thus, we concluded that DBH-AS1 can be induced by HBx and inactivated by p53, and consequently promote cell proliferation and cell survival through activation of MAPK signaling in HCC.	26393879	2015	HBx-related long non-coding RNA DBH-AS1 promotes cell proliferation and survival by activating MAPK signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma.

Mechanistically, lnc-DILC inhibited the autocrine IL-6/STAT3 signaling. The putative binding locus of lnc-DILC within IL-6 promoter was confirmed by pull down assay. Consistently, the oligoribonucleotide mimics and an oligodeoxynucleotide decoy of lnc-DILC abrogated the effects on IL-6 transcription, STAT3 activation and LCSC expansion triggered by lnc-DILC depletion and lnc-DILC overexpression. Moreover, our data suggested that lnc-DILC mediated the crosstalk between TNF-α/NF-κB signaling and IL-6/STAT3 cascade. Clinical investigation demonstrated the reduction of lnc-DILC in patient HCCs, and suggested the correlation between lnc-DILC levels and IL-6, EpCAM or CD24 expression.

Besides, the decreased expression of GAPLINC could significantly repress CRC cell invasion in vitro and also inhibit proliferation in vitro and in vivo.

GAS5 suppresses cancer proliferation by acting as a molecular sponge for miR-21, leading to the de-repression of phosphatase and tensin homologs (PTEN), the endogenous target of miR-21.

In summary, we demonstrate that GAS5 acts as an tumor suppressor lncRNA in endometrial cancer.

HCC patients with higher levels of GAS5 or with the lower levels of miR-21 have longer survival times. There are lower levels of GAS5 and higher levels of miR-21 in HCC cell lines (Be7402, SMMC-7721, and HCCLM3) than in normal liver L-02 cells, and the levels correlate with the aggression of the HCC cell lines. Knockdown of GAS5 upregulates miR-21 levels in Bel-7402 cells (weakly aggressive); in contrast, there are opposite changes in HCCLM3 cells (highly aggressive). Moreover, GAS5 that upregulated or downregulated the expression of PDCD4 and PTEN was reversed by inhibiting or overexpressing miR-21 level in Bel-7402 and HCCLM3 cells. Then, overexpression of GAS5 suppresses the migration and invasion of HCC cells and high expression of miR-21 largely eliminates GAS5-mediated suppression of HCC cell migration and invasion.	26404135	2015	Long noncoding RNA GAS5 suppresses the migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells via miR-21

False-positive report probability (FPRP) was calculated to test the false-positive association. On performing univariate analysis, no significant association between H19 polymorphisms (rs3741219 and rs217727) and BC was observed. However, in further stratified analyses, CT+TT genotypes of rs217727 had a significantly lower risk of breast cancer among women with number of pregnancy >2 (OR = 0.79; 95% CI = 0.55-0.97). CT genotype of rs217727 was associated with ER positivity (OR = 2.19; 95 % CI = 1.07-4.45) and HER-2 positivity (OR = 1.34; 95 % CI = 1.05-2.12).

Loss of either Bcr-Abl expression or Abl kinase activity caused decrease of c-Myc levels with simultaneously reduced levels of H19. Furthermore, we demonstrated that depletion of c-Myc alone in K562 cells significantly decreased the level of H19, suggesting that H19 is expressed in a c-Myc dependent manner in K562 leukemic cells.	24685695	2014	High expression of long non-coding RNA H19 is required for efficient tumorigenesis induced by Bcr-Abl oncogene.

Multivariate analyses revealed that expression of H19 served as an independent predictor for overall survival and disease-free survival. Further experiments revealed that overexpression of H19 promoted the proliferation of CRC cells, while depletion of H19 inhibited cell viability and induced growth arrest. Moreover, expression profile data showed that H19 upregulated a series of cell-cycle genes. Using bioinformatics prediction and RNA immunoprecipitation assays, we identified eIF4A3 as an RNA-binding protein that binds to H19.

On the contrary, Loss of function studies indicated that H19 interference in GBC suppressed tumor cell invasion and promoted mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) via suppressing Twist expression.

Moreover, H19 affected the expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which has also been observed to be up-regulated in NPC and to promote cell invasion. Rather than direct interaction, H19 regulated EZH2 expression by suppressing the activity of miR-630, which is a repressor of EZH2 and interacts with H19 in a sequence-specific manner.

Overexpression of H1.3 suppresses H19 expression, and knockdown of H1.3 increases its expression in multiple ovarian epithelial cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that histone H1.3 overexpression leads to increased occupancy of H1.3 at the H19 regulator region encompassing the imprinting control region (ICR), concomitant with increased DNA methylation and reduced occupancy of the insulator protein CTCF at the ICR.

Mechanistically, HOTAIR is a direct target of ER-mediated transcriptional repression and is thus restored upon the blockade of ER signaling, either by hormone deprivation or by tamoxifen treatment. Interestingly, this elevated HOTAIR increases ER protein level and thus enhances ER occupancy on the chromatin and potentiates its downstream gene regulation.	26364613	2015	LncRNA HOTAIR enhances ER signaling and confers tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.

In addition, we found that estrogen promoted HOTAIR through its receptor GPER and estrogen-induced breast cancer cell migration was reversed by deleting HOTAIR in TN breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231and BT549. Furthermore, we identified that E2-GPER induces the level of HOTAIR through the suppression of miR-148a. miR-148a level was negatively correlated with HOTAIR level in breast cancer patients.

Majority of CaCx cases portrayed HOTAIR down-regulation in comparison to HPV negative controls, with corresponding up-regulation of HOTAIR target, HOXD10, and enrichment of cancer related pathways. However, a small subset had significantly higher HOTAIR expression, concomitant with high E7 expression and enrichment of metastatic pathways.

The decline in the expression of HOTAIR and MALAT1 was clearly evident in BLM-treated HeLa and MCF cells.

Moreover, magnetic nanoparticle-mediated low expression of HOTAIR effectively reduced the tumorigenic capacity of glioma stem cells in vivo. In addition, the results of qRT-PCR and western blot analysis demonstrated that downregulation of HOTAIR expression significantly increased the expression of PDCD4 in GSCs, in addition to reducing the expression of CCND1 and CDK4.

Mechanistically, HOTAIR reduces the recuritment of the CREB, P300, RNA polII onto the SETD2 promoter region that inhibits SETD2 expression and its phosphorylation. Thereby, the SETD2 binding capacity to substrate histone H3 is weakened, triggering a reduction of trimethylation on histone H3 thirty-sixth lysine, and thereby the H3K36me3-hMSH2-hMSH6-SKP2 complex is also decreased	26172293	2015	LncRNA HOTAIR promotes human liver cancer stem cell malignant growth through downregulation of SETD2

Knockdown (siRNA) of HOTAIR decreased PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. miR-34a was also up-regulated by genistein and may directly target HOTAIR in both PC3 and DU145 PCa cells. Our results indicated that genistein inhibited PCa cell growth through down-regulation of oncogenic HOTAIR that is also targeted by tumor suppressor miR-34a.

Furthermore, knock-down of HOTTIP significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration and induced cell apoptosis in vitro. In addition, we identified HOTTIP as a transcriptional regulator of HOXA13 in lung cancer cell.

Moreover, we illustrated that HULC was closely related to DLBCL characteristics, such as Ann Arbor stages, B symptoms, CHOP-like treatment, rituximab and IPI. Importantly, we verified that HULC was an key predictive factor for DLBCL diagnosis and prognosis from sizable samples through the long time follow-ups. Furthermore, we reveal that the HULC knockdown could significantly arrest cell proliferation and induce apoptosis by repressing cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 in DLBCL cells.	27044827	2016	Long noncoding RNA HULC predicts poor clinical outcome and represents pro-oncogenic activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

We found that HULC, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and ESM-1 (endothelial cell specific molecule 1) expression and microvessel density were positively correlated with grade dependency in glioma patient tissues, and that HULC silencing suppressed angiogenesis by inhibiting glioma cells proliferation and invasion. This process induced anoikis and blocked the cell cycle at G1/S phase via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, thus regulating the tumor-related genes involved in the above biological behavior in human glioma U87MG and U251 cells. However, these effects were reversed by ESM-1 overexpression, suggesting a mediating role of ESM-1 in the pro-angiogenesis effect of HULC. Our results define the mechanism of the pro-angiogenesis activity of HULC, which shows potential for application as a therapeutic target in glioma	26894862	2016	HULC long noncoding RNA silencing suppresses angiogenesis by regulating ESM-1 via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in human gliomas

Depletion of IGF2BP1 led to an increased HULC half-life and higher steady-state expression levels, indicating a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism. Importantly, HULC represents the first IGF2BP substrate that is destabilized. To elucidate the mechanism by which IGF2BP1 destabilizes HULC, the CNOT1 protein was identified as a novel interaction partner of IGF2BP1. CNOT1 is the scaffold of the human CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, a major component of the cytoplasmic RNA decay machinery. Indeed, depletion of CNOT1 increased HULC half-life and expression. Thus, IGF2BP1 acts as an adaptor protein that recruits the CCR4-NOT complex and thereby initiates the degradation of the lncRNA HULC.	23728852	2013	Posttranscriptional destabilization of the liver-specific long noncoding RNA HULC by the IGF2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1).

Among the tumor tissues, higher HULC expression is positively associated with Edmondson histological grades or with hepatitis B (HBV) positive status. Moreover, HULC lncRNA is detected with higher frequency in the plasma of HCC patients compared to healthy controls.

The expression of HULC in HepG2 was higher than that in MHCC97L. The over-expression of HULC could enhance proliferation of MHCC97L and HepG2, however, the over-expression of HEIH could not. The over-expression of HULC and HEIH could promote invasion of MHCC97L and HepG2. Invasion of MHCC97L and HepG2 did not have significant change after down-regulating of HEIH and HULC by siRNA.

Moreover, we revealed that HBx up-regulated HULC in human immortalized normal liver L-O2 cells and hepatoma HepG2 cells. Luciferase reporter gene assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that HBx activated the HULC promoter via cAMP-responsive element-binding protein. We further demonstrated that HULC promoted cell proliferation by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, colony formation assay, and tumorigenicity assay. Then, we validated that HULC down-regulated p18, which was involved in the HULC-enhanced cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo.

HULC depletion inhibited the growth and metastasis of HCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, HULC contributes to ZEB1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a requirement for tumor invasion and metastasis that plays a key role in cancer progression.	27285757	2016	LncRNA HULC enhances epithelial-mesenchymal transition to promote tumorigenesis and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma via the miR-200a-3p/ZEB1 signaling pathway.

HULC increased SPHK1 in hepatoma cells. Mechanistically, HULC activated the promoter of SPHK1 in hepatoma cells through the transcription factor E2F1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) further showed that E2F1 was capable of binding to the E2F1 element in the SPHK1 promoter. HULC increased the expression of E2F1 in hepatoma cells and levels of HULC were positively correlated with those of E2F1 in HCC tissues. Intriguingly, HULC sequestered miR-107, which targeted E2F1 mRNA 3'UTR, by complementary base pairing. Functionally, si-SPHK1 remarkably abolished the HULC-enhanced tumor angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, we conclude that HULC promotes tumor angiogenesis in liver cancer through miR-107/E2F1/SPHK1 signaling.	26540633	2015	Long non-coding RNA HULC promotes tumor angiogenesis in liver cancer by up-regulating sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1).

In contrast, other maternal imprinted genes in this region, including p57(KIP2), IMPT1, and IPL exhibited almost normal expression in these samples, although some samples expressed IGF2 biallelically. These results suggest that KCNQ1DN existing far from the H19/IGF2 region may play some role in Wilms' tumorigenesis along with IGF2.	11056398	2000	A novel imprinted gene, KCNQ1DN, within the WT2 critical region of human chromosome 11p15.5 and its reduced expression in Wilms' tumors.

Loss of expression of LIT1 also correlated with enrichment of H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9) dimethylation and reduction of H3 lysine 4 (H3-K4) dimethylation. Thus, LIT1 expression appears to be controlled by epigenetic modifications at the KvDMR1, although CDKN1C expression, which is considered to be controlled by LIT1, was not associated with epigenetic status at the KvDMR1 in some colorectal cancer cell lines. Therefore, these findings suggest that LOI of LIT1 via epigenetic disruption plays an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis, but it is not necessarily associated with CDKN1C expression.	16965397	2006	Expression profile of LIT1/KCNQ1OT1 and epigenetic status at the KvDMR1 in colorectal cancers.

Finally, in silico prediction suggested that different alleles could alter the local structure of KCNQ1OT1. Taken together, our findings suggest that the STR polymorphism within KCNQ1OT1 contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis, possibly by affecting KCNQ1OT1 and CDKN1C expression through a structure-dependent mechanism.	23984860	2013	A novel tetranucleotide repeat polymorphism within KCNQ1OT1 confers risk for hepatocellular carcinoma.

Additionally, we indicated that the increased expression of KRT18P55 was related to the progression of intestinal type (P=0.032), which was also supported by results of independent GC cohorts from TCGA (P<0.01). However, we did not find significant difference in prognosis between patients with high and low expression of KRT18P55 (P>0.05).

Mechanistic investigations showed that LINC00668 was a direct transcriptional target of E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1). We further demonstrated that LINC00668 was associated with PRC2 and that this association was required for epigenetic repression of cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitors (CKIs), including p15, p16, p21, p27 and p57, thus contributing to the regulation of the gastric cancer cell cycle.	27036039	2015	E2F1-induced upregulation of long noncoding RNA LINC00668 predicts a poor prognosis of gastric cancer and promotes cell proliferation through epigenetically silencing of CKIs

Knockdown of LOC389641 impaired cell proliferation and invasion and induced cell apoptosis in vitro, whereas overexpression of LOC389641 had the opposite effect. Further, a significant negative correlation was observed between E-cadherin levels and LOC389641 levels in vivo. Knockdown of LOC389641 upregulated E-cadherin expression, but knockdown of E-cadherin had a limited influence on LOC389641. Importantly, after E-cadherin was inhibited, the enhancement of LOC389641 on cell invasion was hindered. Moreover, the expression of LOC389641 was closely associated with its genomic neighboring gene TNFRSF10A. Lastly, knockdown experiments showed that TNFRSF10A might be a connection between LOC389641and E-cadherin. We conclude that LOC389641 promotes PDAC progression and increases cell invasion by regulating E-cadherin with the possible involvement of TNFRSF10A.	26708505	2016	Long non-coding RNA LOC389641 promotes progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and increases cell invasion by regulating E-cadherin in a TNFRSF10A-related manner.

This alternative Δsv-MALAT1 transcript was mainly underexpressed (18.8%) in our breast tumour series. Multivariate analysis showed that alternative Δsv-MALAT1 transcript is an independent prognostic factor. Δsv-MALAT1 expression was associated with alterations of the pre-mRNAs alternative splicing machinery, and of the Drosha-DGCR8 complex required for non-coding RNA biogenesis.

In CRC, MALAT1 could bind to SFPQ, thus releasing PTBP2 from the SFPQ/PTBP2 complex. In turn, the increased SFPQ-detached PTBP2 promoted cell proliferation and migration. SFPQ critically mediated the regulatory effects of MALAT1. Moreover, in CRC tissues, MALAT1 and PTBP2 were overexpressed, both of which were associated closely with the invasion and metastasis of CRC.

MALAT1 increases AKAP-9 expression by promoting SRPK1-catalyzed SRSF1 phosphorylation. Following MALAT1 knockdown, overexpression of SRPK1 was sufficient to restore SRSF1 phosphorylation and AKAP-9 expression to a level that promoted cell proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro. Conversely, SRPK1 knockdown after overexpression of MALAT1 in SW480 cells diminished SRSF1 phosphorylation and AKAP-9 expression and suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro.

Si-MALAT1/pcDNA-MALAT1 induced the decrease of cell invasion and migration, while the effects were reversed by the transfection of pcDNA-EGFL7/si-EGFL7.

Functionally, knockdown of MALAT1 resulted in an impairment and increased the permeability of BTB as well as decreased the expression of ZO-1, occludin and claudin-5 in GECs. Further, there was reciprocal repression between MALAT1 and miR-140, and miR-140 mediated the effects that MALAT1 knockdown exerted. Mechanistic investigations defined that nuclear factor YA (NFYA), a CCAAT box-binding transcription factor, was a direct and functional downstream target of miR-140, which was involved in the MALAT1 knockdown induced regulation of BTB function.

In order to explore the function of MALAT1, the expression of MALAT1 was greatly reduced in U87 and U251 cells transfected with siRNA specifically targeting MALAT1. Consequently, cell viability of U87 and U251 cells were drastically decreased after the knockdown of MALAT1. Concomitantly, the apoptosis rate of the two cell lines was dramatically increased.

Conversely, overexpression of MALAT1 caused significant reduction in cell proliferation and invasion in vitro, and tumorigenicity in both subcutaneous and intracranial human glioma xenograft models.

For figuring out the effect of MEG3 in breast cancer cells MCF7 and MB231, we overexpressed MEG3 in these cells, and found that it resulted the inhibition of proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion capacities by enhancing p53's transcriptional activity on its target genes, including p21, Maspin and KAI1. MEG3 presented similar effects in MB157, which is a p53-null breast cancer cell line, when functional p53 but not p53R273H mutant, which lacks transcriptional activity, was introduced.

Furthermore, we focused on the function and molecular mechanism of MEG3, finding that overexpression of MEG3 reduced the level of miR-21-5p expression, causing inhibition of proliferation and increased apoptosis in cervical cancer cells.

The transcripts were mainly localized in the nucleus and their expression correlated with the corresponding miRNA clusters. Knockdown of MONC or MIR100HG impeded leukemic growth of AMKL cell lines and primary patient samples.

Furthermore, MT1DP was revealed as a negative regulator of Alfa-fetoprotein (AFP), a classic liver cancer tumor marker, through inhibiting protein synthesis of Forkhead box A1 (FoxA1), an important transcription factor in liver development and cancer progression.	25261601	2014	Tumor suppressor long non-coding RNA, MT1DP is negatively regulated by YAP and Runx2 to inhibit FoxA1 in liver cancer cells.

Moreover, breast cancer patients with high MVIH expression levels showed poor overall survival and disease-free survival. Multivariate analysis results indicated that MVIH was an independent prognostic factor in breast cancer. In addition, upregulated MVIH expression levels promoted cell proliferation and cell cycle, and inhibited cell apoptosis, while reduced MVIH expression showed the converse.	26555546	2015	Long non-coding RNA MVIH is associated with poor prognosis and malignant biological behavior in breast cancer.

In a cohort of 215 HCC patients, the overexpression of MVIH was associated with frequent microvascular invasion and a higher tumor node metastasis stage as well as decreased recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival. We also found that MVIH could promote tumor growth and intrahepatic metastasis by activating angiogenesis in mouse models. Subsequent investigations indicated that MVIH could activate tumor-inducing angiogenesis by inhibiting the secretion of phosphoglycerate kinase 1(PGK1).	22706893	2012	Long noncoding RNA associated with microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma promotes angiogenesis and serves as a predictor for hepatocellular carcinoma patients' poor recurrence-free survival after hepatectomy.

Its expression level was significantly correlated with TNM stages, tumor size, and lymph node metastasis. Moreover, patients with high levels of MVIH expression had a relatively poor prognosis. Ectopic expression of MVIH promoted cell proliferation and invasion in NSCLC cells partly via regulating MMP2 and MMP9 protein expression.	24793017	2014	Long non-coding RNA MVIH indicates a poor prognosis for non-small cell lung cancer and promotes cell proliferation and invasion.

In NBs with MYCN-amplification, these transcripts are significantly higher expressed. Expression of the antisense gene MYCNOS might be relevant to the progression of NB, potentially by directly inhibiting MYCN transcription by transcriptional interference at the DNA level. The MYCNOS:MYCN-ratio in NBs is significantly correlated with both MYCN-amplification and NB-stage.

Positive expression of LINC00312 was negatively correlated with tumor size but positively correlated with lymph node metastasis. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that LINC00312 expression could distinguish non-cancerous patients from NPC patients. These observations indicated that LINC00312 could represent a potential biomarker for metastasis, progression and prognosis in NPC.	23529758	2013	Expression of LINC00312, a long intergenic non-coding RNA, is negatively correlated with tumor size but positively correlated with lymph node metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

NAG7 was a significant negative regulator of protein expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), and activated both the JNK2/AP-1/MMP1 and the upstream H-Ras/p-c-Raf pathways. None of these effects induced by NAG7 over-expression could be counteracted by estrogen.

BANCR-knockdown in a PTC-derived cell line (IHH-4) resulted in significant suppression of thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). BANCR-knockdown also led to inhibition of cell growth and cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase through down-regulation of cyclin D1. In addition, BANCR was enriched by polycomb enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), and silencing BANCR led to decreased chromatin recruitment of EZH2, which resulted significantly reduced expression of TSHR.	26323637	2015	BRAF-activated Long Non-coding RNA Modulates Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Cell Proliferation through Regulating Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor.

We also aimed to develop a strategy to stably silence PCA3. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to knock down PCA3 in LNCaP cells. The expression of 84 cancer-related genes, as well as those coding for AR cofactors and EMT markers, was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). LNCaP-PCA3 silenced cells differentially expressed 16 of the 84 cancer genes tested, mainly those involved in gene expression control and cell signaling. PCA3 knockdown also induced the upregulation of several transcripts coding for AR cofactors and modulated the expression of EMT markers.

The primary genomic sequence in and around intron-1 is sufficient to lead to a differential splicing of this intron.

Knockdown of TATDN1-1 by shRNA significantly inhibited cell proliferation, adhesion, migration and invasion in 95D cells. Further mechanism study showed that TATDN1 knockdown suppressed the expression of E-cadherin, HER2, β-catenin and Ezrin. Moreover, knockdown TATDN1 also inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in a 95D mouse model in vivo by inhibiting β-catenin and Ezrin.

Although uc.8+ is located within intron 1 of CASZ1, a zinc-finger transcription factor, the transcribed non-coding RNA encoding uc.8+ is expressed independently of CASZ1. In vitro experiments evaluating the effects of uc.8+ silencing, showed significantly decreased capacities for cancer cell invasion, migration, and proliferation. From this, we proposed and validated a model of interaction in which uc.8+ shuttles from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of BlCa cells, interacts with microRNA (miR)-596, and cooperates in the promotion and development of BlCa. Using computational analysis, we investigated the miR-binding domain accessibility, as determined by base-pairing interactions within the uc.8+ predicted secondary structure, RNA binding affinity, and RNA species abundance in bladder tissues and showed that uc.8+ is a natural decoy for miR-596. Thus uc.8+ upregulation results in increased expression of MMP9, increasing the invasive potential of BlCa cells. These interactions between evolutionarily conserved regions of DNA suggest that natural selection has preserved this potentially regulatory layer that uses RNA to modulate miR levels, opening up the possibility for development of useful markers for early diagnosis and prognosis as well as for development of new RNA-based cancer therapies	26943042	2016	Long non-coding RNA containing ultraconserved genomic region 8 promotes bladder cancer tumorigenesis

Interestingly, inhibition of TUG1 could upregulate homeobox B7 (HOXB7) expression; ChIP assays demonstrated that the promoter of HOXB7 locus was bound by EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2), a key component of PRC2, and was H3K27 trimethylated. This TUG1-mediated growth regulation is in part due to specific modulation of HOXB7, thus participating in AKT and MAPK pathways. Together, these results suggest that p53-regulated TUG1 is a growth regulator, which acts in part through control of HOXB7.

Mechanistically, P53 (N340Q/L344R) forms complex with CUDR and the complex binds to the promoter regions of PKM2 which enhances the expression, phosphorylation of PKM2 and its polymer formation. Thereby, the polymer PKM2 (tetramer) binds to the eleventh threonine on histone H3 that increases the phosphorylation of the eleventh threonine on histone H3 (pH3T11). Furthermore, pH3T11 blocks HDAC3 binding to H3K9Ac that prevents H3K9Ac from deacetylation and stabilizes the H3K9Ac modification. On the other hand, it also decreased tri-methylation of histone H3 on the ninth lysine (H3K9me3) and increases one methylation of histone H3 on the ninth lysine (H3K9me1). Moreover, the combination of H3K9me1 and HP1 α forms more H3K9me3-HP1α complex which binds to the promoter region of Pim1, enhancing the expression of Pim1 that enhances the expression of TERT, oncogenic lncRNA HOTAIR and reduces the TERRA expression.
