      <annotation section="Characteristics">Ciliated protozoa contain two nuclei, a germline nucleus and a somatic nucleus.
- The somatic nucleus is active but not passed on after fertilization.
- The germline nucleus is transcriptionally inert in the mother cell but is transmitted to progeny. The new somatic nucleus is created from this germline nucleus ((Nowacki 2009)).

In Paramecium tetraurelia creating the new somatic nucleus requires widespread deletion of repetitive sequences and tens of thousands of internal eliminated sequences (IES) to create the compact somatic nucleus in the progeny ((Nowacki 2009)).

Elimination of DNA appears to depend on whether it was present in the maternal somatic nucleus, with DNA present in the maternal somatic nucleus being retained in the progeny somatic nucleus. This process appears to be controlled by interactions between homologous short and long noncoding RNAs ((Nowacki 2009)).
</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">DNA in the somatic nucleus is transcribed into sense and antisense noncoding RNAs during both vegetative growth and sexual reproduction ((LepA re 2008)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">RNA transcripts derived from DNA sequences in the maternal somatic nucleus are necessary but not necessarily sufficient to cause retention of this sequence in the progeny somatic nucleus ((LepA re 2008)).

For example: introduction of an IE sequence into the maternal somatic nucleus is able to maintain the presence of that IES in the somatic nucleus of the progeny in some cases ((Duharcourt 1995), (Duharcourt 1998)).
However degradation of IES RNA transcripts during the vegetal growth stage prevented maintenance of that IES in progeny somatic nuclei, showing long noncoding transcripts from the maternal somatic nuclei were necessary for maintenance of the DNA in progeny ((LepA re 2008)).

Paramecium expresses a complex population of ~25 nuc germline Scan RNAs (scnRNAs) during early meiosis which have homology to all types of germline sequences. Knockdown of scnRNAs allows retention of sequences normally deleted from the progeny somatic nucleus ((LepA re 2008)).

ScnRNA : Maternal ncRNA model 
ScnRNAs signal sequences to be deleted while maternal RNAs signal sequences to be maintained. Hypothesised that maternal somatic RNAs deplete homologous germline scnRNAs, preventing excision of these sequences in progeny somatic nuclei. Whereas undepleted scnRNAs do cause excision of target DNA sequences ((LepA re 2008), (LepA re 2008), (Nowacki 2009)).

      <annotation section="Characteristic">Together with the noncoding RNA BC040587 and the tumor suppressor gene LSAMP (limbic system-associated membrane protein), TUSC7 is present in the focal region of chr3q13.31 (osteo3q13.31), which is the most altered region in osteosarcomas (Mo 2013). Putative p53 response element ~ 1500kb upstream (Mo 2013).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Expression of TUSC7, LSAMP and BC040587 correlated with osteo3q13.31 copy number alterations (Mo 2013). Downregulated in colorectal cancers (CRCs) (Du 2013, Mo 2013). Low expression in CRCs correlated with larger tumor size, higher tumor stage, and more distant metastasis and poor disease-free survival(Du 2013). Inhibits CRC tumor cell growth in vivo and in vitro (Mo 2013). Expression predictive of disease free survival for CRC patients (Du 2013).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Depletion of LOC285194 by siRNA promoted proliferation of normal osteoblasts (with a mild increase in the G1 population) by cell-cycle transcripts (Cyclin D1, VEGF, and VEGFR1 up-regulation, and cyclin A2 and cyclin B1 suppression) as well as regulation of apoptotic genes (such as suppression of BCL2 and BimEL pro-apoptotic genes) (Mo 2013). Genetic deletions of LOC285194 or BC040587 in tumor DNA were also associated with dramatic decrease in survival of osteosarcoma patients (Mo 2013). TUSC7, LSAMP and BC040587 are proposed to be cooperatively acting tumor suppressors (Mo 2013). In CRC, TUSC7 is a p53 regulated tumor suppressor, acting partially through repression of miR-211, a promoter of cell growth. Exon 4 contains the active region for growth inhibition, and contains two miR-211 binding sites (Mo (2013).</annotation>

      <annotation section="Name">LXRBSV: Liver X receptor (LXR)-beta alternative splicing variant ((Hashimoto 2009)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Characteristics">In mouse, LXRBSV is an alternative splicing isoform of LXR-beta that has a 270bp intronic sequence retained between exons 4 and 5 (or exons 2 and 3 depending on LXR-beta isoform). Quantitative expression and promoter reporter assays indicated that LXRBSV is preferentially transcribed and expressed in the pituitary ((Hashimoto 2010)).

5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'-RACE) produced a 677 bp PCR product and indicated that the transcriptional start site (TSS) of LXRBSV is located 40 bp downstream of LXR-beta's TSS ((Hashimoto 2010)).

A LXRBSV construct was translated as an approximately 22 kDa protein by in-vitro translation.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">LXRBSV was detected in various tissues, such as liver and different regions of the brain (pituitary, hypothalamus, cerebrum, cerebellum). It was expressed at lower levels than LXR-beta ((Hashimoto 2009)).

Quantitative expression and promoter reporter assays indicated that LXRBSV is preferentially transcribed and expressed in the pituitary. LXRBSV expression in the whole brain and especially in the pituitary was significantly higher compared to that in the liver. This is in contrast to LXR-beta mRNA that showed similar expression in the liver and brain and significantly reduced expression in the pituitary and hypothalamus compared to liver ((Hashimoto 2010)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">LXRBSV acts as a specific transcriptional co-activator for LXR-beta to enhance its receptor-mediated transactivation. LXRBSV synergistically augmented ligand-dependent activation of the SREBP-1c promoter (Sterol Response Element Binding Protein-1c promoter), but not of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and peroxidase proliferator and activating receptors (PPARs).

The intronic sequence inserted into LXRBSV is required for its transactivation activity.

LXRBSV protein was deduced to be 64 amino acids in length, but different evidence demonstrated that the alternative splicing transcript acts as a RNA co-activator: 1) a GAL4-LXRBSV fusion protein was not able to induce transactivation; 2) an ATG mutant of LXRBSV was able to induce transactivation as wild type, and 3) LXRBSV functions in the presence of cycloheximide ((Hashimoto 2009)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Misc">Because the LXRB locus produces both functional protein-coding and regulatory RNA transcripts, it may be considered a 'bi-functional' locus.</annotation>

      <annotation section="Characteristics">Processed pseudogene of PTEN tumour suppressor gene at 9p13.3 and  ~3.9kb in length.
Predominately polyA- ((Johnsson 2013)).PTENP1 &quot;coding sequence&quot; quite similar to PTEN but has lost start codon, while 3'UTR is ~1kb shorter than PTEN. Part of the PTENP1 3'UTR sequence is highly conserved compared to PTEN (~95%) with seed matches to the same miRNAs</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Expressed in a very wide variety of human tissues and in prostate cancer. Good correlation between PTENP1 and PTEN levels.

Inhibition of endogenous miRNAs with seed matches to PTEN and PTENP1 leads to an increase in PTENP1 expression, validating it is targeted by miRNAs known to repress PTEN.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). PTENP1, through its 3'UTR, acts as a decoy for miRNAs that target PTEN.

PTNEP1 functions as a tumour suppressor gene.

Overexpression of the PTENP1 3'UTR lead to an increased level of PTEN and cellular growth inhibition, an effect dependent on the presence of mature miRNAs, supporting PTENP1's role as a miRNA decoy. While knockdown of PTENP1 lead to a decrease in PTEN levels and faster cell growth.

PTENP1 asRNA beta isoform forms an RNA-RNA interaction with PTENP1 sense and stabilizes it. This interaction promotes the function of PTENP1 sense as a positive regulator of PTEN mRNA levels, potentially by allowing the export of PTENP1 sense to the cytoplasm ((Johnsson 2013)).

The PTENP1 locus was lost in a subset of colon cancers and a relationship was reported between PTENP1 copy number and PTEN expression level.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Misc">Cells are very sensitive to levels of PTEN, with even subtle changes influencing cancer susceptibility ((Alimonti 2010)).

A wider role for pseudogenes as miRNA decoys/ sponges has been proposed.</annotation>

      <annotation section="Name">Rian: RNA Imprinted and Accumulated in Nucleus 
Irm: Imprinted RNA near Meg3/Gtl2
MEG8: Maternally expressed gene 8</annotation>
      <annotation section="Characteristics">These overlapping but non-identical transcripts are found in the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted region ((Hatada 2001), (Royo 2007), (Hagan 2009)) and should probably be viewed as different isoforms of the Rian gene. The human and mouse loci are quite similar, whereas the rat loci (Bsr gene) has undergone significant divergence and so has its own entry in the database.

Spliced lncRNAs that contain a number of intronic snoRNAs and sometimes miRNAs (CavaillÃ© (2002), (Royo 2007), (Hagan 2009)). 

In human and mouse, transcription of the Meg8 isoform can extend through the snoRNA clusters. Mouse Meg8 is ~4.4kb with over 20 exons. In mouse the ~2.5 kb Irm transcript contains the last 10 exons of Meg8 but has its own transcriptional start site. Mouse Meg8 contains intronic miRNAs not found in Irm ((Hagan 2009)).

RNA sequencing confirms a large number of isoforms with alternative splicing and also retained introns exist at this locus though no evidence was found for Rian overlapping the Meg9/Mirg transcript ((Guttman 2010)). It is unclear if the Irm isoform exists in humans.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Imprinted: Maternally expressed ((Hatada 2001), (Charlier 2001), CavaillÃ© (2002)).

Expressed predominately in brain ((Hatada 2001)), embryo and muscle ((Charlier 2001)) with generally weak expression in other tissues ((Hagan 2009)). Expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells ((Guttman 2011)). In mouse the longer 'Meg8' transcript is also expressed in skin whereas the shorter 3' 'Irm' is not ((Hagan 2009)).

Up-regulated during differentiation of neuronal progenitors to GABAergic neurons in vitro ((Mercer 2010)).

Localised to the nucleus ((Hatada 2001)).

Intronic snoRNAs also show brain and embryo imprinted expression (CavaillÃ© (2002)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">LncRNAs contain a number of miRNAs and snoRNAs, little is known about the molecular function of the lncRNAs.

Rian transcript(s) bind to the PRC2 chromatin modifying complex in mouse embryonic stem cells ((Zhao 2010), (Guttman 2011)). Rian was also found to interact with a number of other chromatin binding protein(s)/complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells including PRC1, JARID1B, JARID1C and CBX3, with the general pattern being interaction with repressors of gene expression ((Guttman 2011)).

Aberrant repression of Rian and other maternally expressed lncRNAs from the DLK1-Dio3 imprinting cluster is present in most induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines and is responsible for the failure of iPSCs to form viable mice, with embryos dying mid-gestation ((Stadtfeld 2010)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">Bsr and Rian/MEG8/Irm are not highly conserved between species (CavaillÃ© (2002)). However, some Rian exons show good homology to Bsr and while many snoRNAs are specific to one species others are homologous ((Hatada 2001), CavaillÃ© (2002)).

Rian gene is present in mammals.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Summary">Comparing human, mouse and rat: All contain ncRNA gene(s) with intronic snoRNAs at this locus. The snoRNAs vary between species, but there are some homologous snoRNAs between each suggesting an evolutionary history with species specific snoRNA addition and duplication (CavaillÃ© (2002)).

The expression profiles of Bsr, Rian/Irm/MEG8 and the snoRNAs they contain are similar between rat, human and mouse.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Misc">Human UCSC browser link below is for Refseq Meg8, however it is clear from known human mRNAs that transcripts from the Meg8 locus can extend much further than the current Refseq annotation.</annotation>

      <annotation section="Expression">There was low expression of antisense transcripts constitutively but abundance increased in aged cells as PHO84 was silenced.

PHO84 antisense transcripts are degraded by the exosome, but increased in abundance in aged cells due to transcript stabilisation. </annotation>

In aged cells exosome dissociates from PHO84 locus allowing the stabilisation and accumulation of PHO84 antisense transcripts.

Antisense RNAs recruit the histone deacetylase complex (Hda1, Hda2, Hda3) to the PHO84 locus, causing deacetylation and PHO84 silencing.

Blocking expression of full length PHO84 antisense transcripts prevented PHO84 silencing, demonstrating the antisense transcripts (not just transcription) was necessary for silencing.

In mouse, Sry has long inverted repeats on either side of the Sry ORF. Transcriptional initiation within the 5' repeat extending through to the 3' repeat allows the formation of a stem loop structure, which promotes circularisation of the transcript. Transcription that starts after the 5' repeat gives rise to a linear Sry transcript (Dubin 1995), (Dolci 1997), (Sekido 2012).</annotation>

      <annotation section="Background">Ciliated protozoa contain two nuclei, a germline nucleus and a somatic nucleus.
- The somatic nucleus is transcriptionally active but not passed on after fertilization.
- The germline nucleus is transcriptionally inert in the mother cell but is transmitted to        progeny. The new somatic nucleus is created from this germline nucleus ((Nowacki 2009)).

In Oxytricha trifallax creating the new somatic nucleus involves chromosomal fragmentation and deletion to remove ~95% of the genome ((Nowacki 2009)).

Hundreds of thousands of short sequences must then be &quot;unscrambled&quot; by reordering or inversion to create a compact somatic genome of nanochromosomes  ((Nowacki 2009)).

This extremely specific and reproducible  rearrangement has now been found to guided by maternal RNAs ((Nowacki 2009)).</annotation>

Long sense and antisense RNA transcripts, which appear to be transcribed full length nanochromsomes (contained telomere sequences), from the somatic nucleus were identified during early development when rearrangement is believed to be occurring ((Nowacki 2007)).</annotation>

Act as RNA guides or scaffolds to direct rearrangements. RNAi against them prevented unscrambling and injection of guides with altered gene sequences lead to the rearranged DNA containing the alteration ((Nowacki 2007)).

Cellular machinery required to carry out the DNA fragmentation and recombination is not fully understood but transposase proteins from Oxytricha trifallax transposons are required ((Nowacki 2009)).

      <annotation section="Name">Xist: X inactive-specific transcript</annotation>
      <annotation section="Characteristics">Spliced, polyadenylated, ~17kb in mice, ~19kb in humans.

Contains repeated sequence motifs A-F that are critical for its function.

Xist is located on the X chromosome in the X-inactivation center (Xic), an approximately 100-kb region in the mouse containing (as of June 2012) five other lncRNAs, many of which play crucial roles in X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). 

Xist expression initiates the process of XCI in mammals.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Xist is expressed in all somatic cells in female eutherian mammals, monoallelically from the inactive X-chromosome (Xi) ((Brown 1991)). Xist is not expressed in males

Xist is a nuclear RNA that coats the Xi ((Brown 1992), (Clemson 1996)). 

In the mouse, Xist expression is imprinted at specific times and places in development: Xist is transcribed exclusively from the paternally-inherited X (and thus the paternal X is always the Xi) only in the early pre-implantation blastocyst, and later in development only in extra-embryonic tissues such as the placenta.

Imprinted XCI in humans has not been demonstrated and may not exist ((Moreira de Mello 2010)).

In somatic tissues in mouse and human, XCI is random, not imprinted: either the paternal or maternal X can express Xist and become the Xi. This decision is made in each cell of the epiblast in the mouse, and the same X is inactivated in subsequent generations of daughter cells. Thus expression of Xist (and of nearly all X-linked genes) is mosaic, in the sense that each of the two alleles is active in different populations of cells.

Stage specific expression in different regions of developing mouse retina, with Tsix displaying a similar but weaker profile ((Blackshaw 2004)).

In female undifferentiated mouse ES (embryonic stem) and iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells, Xist is not expressed and both X chromosomes are active. Differentiation of mouse ES cells results in the onset of Xist expression and XCI, and thus these cells are an important model system for the study of XCI.

In contrast, Xist expression and XCI are variable in female undifferentiated human ES cells ((Shen 2008), (Silva 2008), (Hall 2008), (Lengner 2010)) and iPS cells ((Bruck 2011), (Hanna 2009), (Marchetto 2010), (Tchieu 2010)), which may reflect variability in the broader epigenetic states and developmental potential of these cells.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Xist is the master regulator of mammalian XCI, the mechanism of dosage compensation that balances X-linked gene expression between males and females.

Xist function is required to initiate XCI ((Penny 1996), (Marahrens 1997)). Ectopic Xist expression from an autosomal transgene causes long-range gene repression in cis ((Wutz 2000)).

Xist and RepA (see associated components below) RNAs bind to and recruit PRC2, which catalyzes the deposition of the repressive chromatin mark H3K27me3 on the Xi ((Zhao 2008), (Kaneko 2010), (Kanhere 2010), (Zhao 2010), (Guil 2012)).

Small RNAs formed from Xist/Tsix duplexes may play a role in regulating Xist expression and XCI ((Ogawa 2008)). However, loss of Dicer has only a modest effect on Xist expression ((Kanellopoulou 2009)), contrary to what would be expected if RNAi is a major regulator of XCI.

hnRNP U (also known as SP120 or SAF-A) binds Xist through its RGG domain while the SAF domain is also required for localisation to the Xi. hnRNP U is required for both Xist localisation to the Xi and the initation of X-inactivation ((Hasegawa 2010).

Xist Repeat C sequences are required for Xist localization to the Xi ((Beletskii 2001), (Sarma 2010)).

YY1 can interact with several DNA binding sites within exon 1 of Xist, and also to the repeat C (and perhaps repeat B) RNA sequences of the Xist transcript. Thus YY1 tethers Xist RNAs to the Xi and nucleates the Xist cloud that coats the Xi ((Jeon 2011)).

Xist forms a transcriptionally silenced sub-nuclear domain ((Chaumeil 2006)) and perinucleolar localisation of the silent Xist coated chromosome has been observed ((Zhang 2007)). The A region repeats are essential for the recruitment of late inactivated X genes to the silencing compartment and for the recruitment of the silencing complex PRC2 ((Maenner 2010)).

After the initiation of XCI, Xist function is not absolutely required to maintain XCI in fibroblasts ((Csankovszki 1999)). Nor is continued Xist expression required to maintain XCI-like repression around an autosomal Xist transgene in male, differentiated ES cells ((Wutz 2000)). However, lack of Xist function in differentiated cells can lead to partial reactivation of select X-linked genes ((Csankovszki 2001)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">Xist is present in all eutherian (placental) mammals examined to date, but it is not present in marsupials or monotremes ((Duret 2006), (Davidow 2007), (Hore 2007), (Shevchenko 2007)). An unrelated ncRNA in marsupials, Rsx, is likely to play a role similar to that of Xist in XCI ((Grant 2012)).

The most conserved Xist RNA region, the A region, contains eight or nine repeats separated by U-rich spacers.</annotation>

      <annotation section="Name">SOX2OT: SOX2 overlapping transcript</annotation>
      <annotation section="Characteristics">SOX2OT holds within one of its introns the single-exon SOX2 gene, overlapping in the same transcriptional orientation ((Fantes 2003)).

Sox2ot has multiple transcription start sites, and several splicing isoforms and polyadenylation sites ((Amaral 2009)).

Mouse full-length clones range in size from 638 nt (GenBank accession no. BY721402) to ~3.5 kb (accession no. AK031919), consistent with Northern blot signals in mouse tissues, which show a major band of ~3kb, but also additional discrete bands of ~1, 4, 6, and &gt;10 kb. In zebrafish embryos, Northern blot analysis showed a major band of ~2.5 kb, as well as less intense bands of ~1.5 and ~6 kb ((Amaral 2009)).

Alternative transcriptional start sites for Sox2ot homologs detected in different vertebrates are associated with highly conserved elements, transposon-free regions and histone modifications typical of promoters. These include a distal promoter that creates a Sox2ot isoform named Sox2dot (&quot;Sox2 distal overlapping transcript&quot;), located more than 0.5Mb upstream of the Sox2 gene in mouse ((Amaral 2009)), and which also has demonstrated enhancer activity in mouse developing forebrain.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Sox2ot is a stable transcript expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells, which, like Sox2, is down-regulated upon induction of embryoid body (EB) differentiation, but, unlike Sox2, is up-regulated during EB late differentiation. Sox2ot absolute levels are higher in cultured neurospheres, and Sox2 and Sox2ot are concordantly up-regulated in differentiated neurospheres. Sox2dot isoform is expressed at very low levels in undifferentiated neurospheres, but with a marked increase in the more differentiated neurospheres.

In situ hybridization analysis of mouse brain sections of Sox2ot and Sox2dot expression detected both transcripts in zones of adult neurogenesis, such as the subventricular zone, rostral migratory stream and olfactory bulb (where Sox2dot is most highly expressed) ((Mercer 2008), (Amaral 2009)).

Many Sox2ot isoforms are present in whole embryo and newborn mouse. In adult mouse, different isoforms are detected primarily in brain, but also at lower levels in tissues where Sox2 is detected, such as lung, or not detected, such as testis. In adult tissues, Sox2dot was only detected in brain.

Highly enriched binding of neuronal transcriptional repressor NRSF/REST has been found in conserved sites upstream of Sox2ot.

Sox2ot is dynamically regulated during chicken and zebrafish embryogenesis, consistently associated with central nervous system structures, including fish embryo eyes, but also mesoderm tissues. During chicken development, increasing levels ofSox2ot were observed after 2days of embryonic development, similar to the pattern observed for Sox2, although with lower absolute expression levels. Expression of both Sox2 and Sox2ot was enriched to the head of 6.5-d chicken embryos, compared to the limbs and whole body. In fish, sox2 and sox2ot presented concordant up-regulation after the sphere stage, suggesting that both are early zygotic genes, but their expression patterns diverged after the tailbud stage when sox2ot total levels decreased. Sox2dot is expressed at very low levels in early embryos, but is dramatically induced at 5 dpf.

In humans, qRT-PCR analysis showed that SOX2OT is highly enriched in the brain, where SOX2 is also predominantly expressed, but also detected in other tissues such as testis. The distribution of SOX2OT ESTs in human tissues also showed a high predominance in CNS libraries, with greatest enrichment in &quot;lens,&quot; followed by subthalamic nucleus and Alzheimer cortex, while it is found in lowest relative abundance in cerebellum ((Amaral 2009)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Function of Sox2ot is undetermined. SOX2OT is a candidate gene involved in myopia, as upstream or intronic regions of Sox2ot isoforms were identified as a myopia common susceptibility locus by linkage disequilibrium analysis ((Andrew 2008)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">Isoforms are positionally conserved in vertebrates. At primary sequence level, although not highly conserved overall, there are regions of high conservation, such as a 384nt-stretch in the exons immediately flanking Sox2 with 91.2% identity between the mouse and human genomes ((Amaral 2009)).

Some exons of SOX2OT may be species- or clade-specific ((Amaral 2009)).

Multiple SOX2OT promoters are associated with highly conserved elements in vertebrates and orthologous transcripts are detected with transcription start sites of transcripts detected in fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals ((Amaral 2009)).</annotation>

      <annotation section="Function">Overexpression of npc48 in Arabidopsis thaliana led to strong leaf serration (a symptom of defects in cell proliferation along the margins of leaf primordia). Plants overexpressing npc48 showed other drastic developmental anomalies, including an increase in the rosette diameter and a delay in flowering time compared with wild-type plants.

The phenotype of npc48-over-expressing plants resembles that of plants over-expressing MIR168, which have reduced levels of the miR168 AGO1 target, and of AGO1-sensitive miRNAs such as miR166. They also show decreased miR166 accumulation, but presence of AGO1 mRNA and miR168 at wild-type levels.

In addition, npc48 plants exhibited reduced accumulation of miR164, suggesting that npc48 could regulate a subset of miRNAs. Interestingly, mir164a mutants also display abnormal serrations of the leaf margins, which are milder than the serrations induced by overexpression of npc48, suggesting that the reduction in miR164 alone cannot account for the phenotype.

Over-expression of npc48 did not have a general effect on miRNAs or AGO1 accumulation ((Ben Amor 2008)).</annotation>

      <annotation section="Characteristics">Several lncRNA transcripts, alpha, beta and unspliced, expressed antisense to PTENP1 pseudogene (also known as PTENpg1)

Alpha and beta isoforms are, at least, four exon transcripts that differ in the position of the transcription start site (TSS). Alpha isoform initiates 5' and so has a longer first exon.

Unspliced isoform initiates transcription from alpha TSS.

Spliced transcripts show evidence of alternative splicing of exon 3.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Alpha and beta spliced isoforms found predominately in cytoplasm and polyA +. Unspliced alpha isoform was predominately in nucleus and polyA-.

Expression of PTENP1 asRNAs negatively correlates with expression of PTEN coding gene and positively correlates with PTENP1 sense pseudogene expression. Combined, the PTENP1 asRNAs generally showed higher expression than the sense PTENP1 pseudogene.

AsRNAs expressed in a number of cell lines including HEK293T, U2OS, A375 and DU145.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">PTENP1 asRNA alpha:
Inhibits transcription of the PTEN coding gene (knockdown caused up-regulation of PTEN, while asRNA alpha overexpression inhibited PTEN mRNA levels). 

PTENP1 asRNA alpha acts in trans by localising to the PTEN coding gene promoter and inhibiting expression. Repression of PTEN by PTENP1 asRNA alpha also involves EZH2 and DNMT3A. PTENP1 asRNA alpha binds DNMT3A (DNA methylase) and is required for the deposition of repressive H3K27me3 chromatin marks at the PTEN promoter.

PTENP1 asRNA alpha regulation of PTEN is functionally significant. Loss of asRNA alpha leads to increased PTEN and p21 protein levels, negatively regulating the cell cycle and also sensitizing cells to apoptosis.

PTENP1 asRNA beta:
PTENP1 asRNA beta isoform forms an RNA-RNA interaction with PTENP1 sense and stabilizes it. This interaction promotes the function of PTENP1 sense as a positive regulator of PTEN mRNA levels, potentially by allowing the export of PTENP1 sense to the cytoplasm.

Summary:
PTENP1 asRNA alpha and beta have different functions. Alpha negatively regulating PTEN transcription and beta positively regulating PTEN mRNA post-transcriptionally through PTENP1 sense. 
Sense and antisense transcrips from PTEN pseduogene regulate both transcription and translation of PTEN.</annotation>

      <annotation section="Characteristics">2.2 kb; spliced, polyadenylated and comprised of 6 exons in humans ((Rinn 2007)). 

Transcribed from the HOXC locus from a position intergenic and antisense to the flanking HOXC11 and HOXC12 genes ((Rinn 2007)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Expressed in posterior and distal fibroblasts ((Rinn 2007)).

Expression level in cancer is an efficient predictor of metastasis and survival with high expression levels predictive of poor outcomes ((Gupta 2010)). Also in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC), HOTAIR expression levels were higher in cancerous tissues than in noncancerous tissues, with high HOTAIR expression tightly correlated with the presence of liver metastasis and associated with poor prognosis ((Kogo 2011)) .

Some HOTAIR transcripts localise to the nucleus ((Khalil 2009)).

In situ hybridization analysis of the mouse cognate RNA (mHotair) showed expression similar to Hoxc11, with distinct levels in parts of the proximal hindlimbs, genital bud and tail in embryos at E11.5, as well as in in posterior part of the hindlimb and genital bud at E12.5 ((Schorderet 2011)). 

Transcript found to be quite unstable with a half-life &gt;4 hr in human Hela cells ((Tani 2012)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Originally identified as silencing the HoxD locus but has since been found to epigenetic silence gene expression at many sites across the genome by recruitment of PRC2 and LSD1/CoREST/REST repressive chromatin modifying complexes ((Rinn 2007), (Tsai 2010)).

HOTAIR acts as a scaffold for protein complexes. A 5' domain binds PRC2 while a 3' domain binds LSD1 ((Tsai 2010)).

Oncogene - regulates metastatic progression ((Gupta 2010))((Schorderet 2011)).

HOTAIR dysregulated in breast cancer with frequent overexpression in metastases. 
Overexpression of HOTAIR leads to PRC2 re-targeting across the genome to a state similar to that in embryonic fibroblasts, promoting tumour invasion and metatasis.  Oncogenic effects of HOTAIR upregulation were dependent on PRC2 ((Gupta 2010)).

Deletion of the HoxC cluster containing the cognate Hotair transcript in mouse showed little phenotypic effect, with little change in the expression on levels of H3K27me3 coverage in corresponding human HOTAIR Hoxd target genes ((Schorderet 2011)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">HOTAIR exists in mammals but with poor sequence conservation ((Rinn 2007))((He 2011)). A 239 bp domain in HOTAIR exon 6 is especially conserved in mammals ((He 2011)).

The mouse EST (AK035706) homologous to human HOTAIR is comprised of two exons only, with the second half of the first exon showing similarity to exon 4 of HOTAIR, whereas the second exon is homologous to exon 6 of HOTAIR ((Schorderet 2011)). This may underlie differences in function since the first three exons of HOTAIR (absent from mHotair) contain binding sites for EZH2, while the 3' extremity of human HOTAIR that interact with LSD1 is part of the least conserved DNA sequence within mHotair exon 2 ((Schorderet 2011)).</annotation>

      <annotation section="Expression">CAR Intergenic 10, ADAM12 and FANK1 are co-expressed in different tissues, including placenta, brain and a human skin fibroblast (HF) cell line. 

CAR Intergenic 10 was most highly expressed in HF cells and very lowly expressed in brain, with placenta in-between.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Positively regulates gene expression of FANK1 and ADAM12 neighboring genes through modulating the chromatin structure in cis, as siRNA knock-down of the Intergenic10 ncRNA results in reduced expression of both FANK1 and ADAM12 mRNAs, with a significant decrease in the level of active chromatin mark H3K4me2 on FANK1 and ADAM12 promoters.

Knock-down of the ncRNA had no effect on the expression of two tested distal genes, UROS and DOCK1.

Note: Despite its overlap with the 3' end of ADAM12, Intergenic 10 is not simply an Adam12 3'UTR, as siRNA knockdown of Adam12 failed to decrease FANK1 expression unlike knockdown of CAR Intergenic 10. </annotation>

      <annotation section="Name">BACE1 antisense RNA</annotation>
      <annotation section="Characteristics">~2 kb; two splice variants were identified for human and mouse BACE1-AS. Transcribed  from an intron of the beta-secretase-1 (BACE1) gene in antisense direction it also completely overlapps exon 6 of BACE-1 ((Faghihi 2008)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">BACE1 and BACE1AS are co-expressed in a wide range of tissues and cell lines in mice and humans. BACE1 mRNA expression levels are higher than BACE1-AS levels across all tissues examined, except in Alzheimer's disease (AD) where, in contrast, BACE1-AS is expressed at a higher level in brain. Bace1 and Bace1-AS transcripts are also observed in various regions of the mouse brain ((Faghihi 2008), (Faghihi 2010)).

Several cell stressors, such as high temperature, serum starvation, amyloid-beta 1-42, H2O2 and high glucose, specifically increase BACE1-AS RNA and BACE1 protein levels ((Faghihi 2008)).

Showed increased expression in sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM) muscle fibers (possibly caused by endoplasmic reticulum stress). Nevertheless, unlike in AD and AD-transgenic mouse brain samples in which BACE1-AS transcript was increased more than the sense BACE1 transcript , in s-IBM muscle biopsies the reversed was found ((Nogalska 2010)).

Mouse RNA stability was very close to median for lncRNAs, with a half-life 3.6 hr in N2A (neuroblastoma) cells ((Clark 2012)). </annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">BACE1AS expression is elevated in Alzheimers disease ((Faghihi 2008)). It was shown to regulate BACE1 mRNA and protein expression in vitro and in vivo ie: over-expression, shRNA and siRNA knockdown of BACE1AS affected BACE1 expression, influencing amyloid-beta 1-42 levels ((Faghihi 2008)).

It was proposed that BACE1-AS and BACE1 form an RNA duplex and this increases the stability of BACE1 ((Faghihi 2008)). More recently, it was suggested that BACE1AS may prevent translational repression of BACE1 mRNA by miR-485-5p via masking the binding site for the microRNA. Supporting this hypothesis, BACE1AS over-expression prevented miRNA-induced suppression ((Faghihi 2010)). Expression of BACE1-AS as well as miR-485-5p are dysregulated in RNA samples from Alzheimer's disease subjects compared to control individuals ((Faghihi 2010)). 

BACE1-AS may also be involved in sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM), whose muscle-fiber phenotype shares molecular similarities with Alzheimer-disease brain (including increased BACE1 protein). BACE1-AS and BACE1 transcripts are significantly increased in s-IBM, and experimental induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress increased both BACE1-AS and BACE1 transcripts. These results suggest that ER stress and increased BACE1-AS expression may be involved in s-IBM ((Nogalska 2010)).</annotation>

Later in paraxial mesoderm, epithelial ducts, and also in skeletal muscle, cochlea, brain and eye ((Schuster-Gossler 1998), (Manji 2005)). 

Dynamically expressed during mouse CNS development. This includes expression during retinal development ((Blackshaw 2004)) and in many developing forebrain areas including the &quot;diencephalon, ventral telencephalon, post mitotic cell layers of the neocortex and pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus&quot; ((McLaughlin 2005)).

Isoform Meg3a is detected in human normal pituitary gland, but is absent in nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas ((Zhang 2003)).

Expressed in the nucleus accumbens of normal human brains and upregulated in this brain region in heroin abusers ((Michelhaugh 2010)). Conversely, levels are decreased in the caudate nucleus of patients suffering from the neurodegenerative condition, Huntington's disease ((Johnson 2011)).

      <annotation section="Localisation">Localisation was generally nuclear, but some cells showed localisation to the cytoplasm or to both compartments ((Schuster-Gossler 1998)). In the nucleus Meg3 has been found associated with chromatin ((Mondal 2010)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Regulation">Expression of Meg3 is stimulated by cyclic-AMP (cAMP). cAMP stimulates CREB transcription factor(s) to bind a cyclic-AMP-response element (CRE) in the proximal promoter which is important for Meg3 expression. Methylation of this promoter region blocks cAMP action ((Zhao 2006)).
</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Summary: Meg3 is important for proper growth and development and is a putative tumour suppressor which functions to activate p53 and inhibit cell proliferation. Meg3 can also control gene expression at imprinted loci through recruitment of the PRC2 complex. 

Function in Cancer:
Expression of the Meg3a splicing isoform was silenced in pituitary tumours and ectopic expression was found to inhibit growth in human cancer cells, leading to the proposition that Meg3 RNA acts as a growth suppressor ((Zhang 2003)).

Silencing of Meg3 is associated with meningioma pathogenesis and progression while ectopic expression inhibited growth and stimulated p53 ((Zhang 2010)).

Meg3 knock-out increased expression of VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) signaling pathway genes in the brain, suggesting the RNA has a role in the control of vascularization, and therefore may function as a tumor suppressor in part by inhibiting angiogenesis ((Gordon 2010)).


Mechanism of action:
Meg3 stimulates p53 expression and can also inhibit cell proliferation/ DNA synthesis in the absence of p53 suggesting these functions are independent of each other ((Zhou 2007)), (Zhang 2009). Meg3 contains several predicted secondary structural elements common to all isoforms. Replacement of the motif most important in p53 activation with a different sequence that formed the same structure maintained Meg3 function showing the RNA structural motifs are critical to Meg3 function ((Zhang 2009)). 

Meg3 binds the PRC2 chromatin modification complex in mouse embryonic stem cells.  Binding appears to be mediated by the 5â€™ 1kb of the RNA ((Zhao 2010)).

Controls expression of Dlk1 at the Dlk1-Meg3 imprinted locus, likely by recruiting PRC2 to the Dlk1 locus in cis. Knockdown lead to increased expression of Dlk1 and Gtl2-as along with a decrease in Ezh2/PRC2 recruitment to and H3K27me3 marks at the Dlk1 promoter ((Zhao 2010)).


Developmental phenotypes:
Knockout of Meg3 and the Meg3 differentially methylated region (DMR) on the maternal allele lead to post-birth lethality, while paternal knockout lead to increased pre and post-birth lethality and growth retardation. However other lncRNAs (Rian, Meg9) were also down-regulated, perhaps due to the loss of the DMR, making attribution of the phenotype to specific lncRNAs difficult ((Takahashi 2009)). A potentially more specific lacZ gene trap insertion gave a parent of origin dwarfism phenotype ((Schuster-Gossler 1998)).

Aberrant repression of Meg3 and other maternally expressed lncRNAs from the DLK1-Dio3 imprinting cluster is present in most induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines and is responsible for the failure of iPSCs to form viable mice ((Stadtfeld 2010)). 
NB: iPSC embryos died mid-gestation, which was more severe than a maternal Meg3 KO ((Takahashi 2009)) indicating the phenotypic impact of other lncRNAs from this locus ((Stadtfeld 2010)).</annotation>

Mira was required for the recruitment of MLL1 to the Mira gene locus and the activation of Hoxa6 and Hoxa7. Mira mediated a local rearrangement in chromatin structure to bring the Mira, Hox66 and Hoxa7 loci into a complex providing a mechanism for MLL1 to act on HoxA6/A7 after recruitment to the Mira locus.

Mira bound to the SET domain of MLL1 through a short hairpin (activator binding motif, ABM) near the 3â€™ end of the RNA. In vitro binding studies suggested MLL1 recruitment was mediated by Mira forming a RNA/DNA hybrid with a protruding ssRNA 3â€™ end containing the ABM. </annotation>

      <annotation section="Name">Zfhx2as: zinc finger homeobox 2, antisense</annotation>
      <annotation section="Characteristics">Antisense transcription begins 6-10kb downstream of the Zfhx2 polyA site and ends in first exon of Zfhx2.

Alternatively spliced. Multiple start sites.

Estimated as up to ~30 kb in length.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Expressed in a number of specific regions in the developing mouse brain including the rostral migratory stream (RMS). 

Antisense RNA was expressed in a complementary manner to the sense coding sequence. For example the antisense RNA was expressed initially in hippocampal development, with the sense RNA only starting to be expressed when antisense transcription declined. Or, alternatively in the dorsal forebrain where sense and antisense transcripts are expressed in different layers of cells at the same stage.

Expression was highest in mid-gestation E13.5-E16.5.

Adult expression specific to brain, with expression in areas of adult neurogenesis.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Zfhx2as negatively regulates the expression of Zfhx2.

Knockout of antisense RNA lead to up-regulation of Zfhx2 expression, with coding gene expression in areas previously showing only expression of the antisense transcript. The same effect was seen in a mutant where Zfhx2 and Zfhx2as no longer overlapped strongly suggesting Zfhx2as negatively regulates Zfhx2.

Human transcript found to show greater stability that SNHG1 in Hela cells ((Makarova 2005)). Also found to be quite stable in human B cells with a half-life of 7 hr, while mouse Snhg6 was significantly less stable (half-life 2.2hrs in 3T3 cells), suggesting the transcripts may have different stabilities between species ((Friedel 2009), (Clark 2012)). 

Minority of SNHG6 associates with monosomes. 

Blocking translation led to a very modest increase in SNHG6 levels, in contrast to SNHG1 (which showed a large increase in transcript level) suggesting it is not very sensitive to nonsense mediated decay. This may help explain its increased stability. </annotation>

SINE (short interspersed nucleotide element - AluJb). 21A lacks the Alu-specific intragenic consensus elements needed to promote its pol III transcription such as the blocks A and B, which points to transcription driven by an extragenic type 3 pol III promoter.

Very low free energy (deltaG) value (deltaG &lt; -100) indicating strong secondary structure.</annotation>

The level of 21A transcription was very low in three immortalized, fully proliferating cell lines (HeLa, 293T, and LAN5) compared to unproliferating/resting PBL (peripheral blood lymphocyte) cells. Similarly, the 21A RNA level in primary skin fibroblasts was higher than in 293T cells, reinforcing an inverse correlation between endogenous 21A expression and cell proliferation. </annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">21AS is one of a number of RNAP III-transcribed short ncRNAs that have sequence complementarity to protein-coding genes, possibly acting as as a natural trans-chromosomal antisense RNA. Aligned to the human genome, it shows several homology hits, among which the most highly significant were associated to multiple intronic regions of centromeric protein F gene (CENP-F). In vitro over-expression of 21AS transcripts inhibits CENP-F protein accumulation and decreased levels of CENP-F mRNA, indicating that 21AS regulates CENP-F expression in trans.

21A RNAs has a role in the control of the proliferation of human tumor cell lines, possibly via regulation of CENP-F expression. This effect was not observed in a mouse cell line.</annotation>

      <annotation section="Function">Beta2.7 RNA has a fundamental role in preventing stress response and apoptosis of the host cell, by binding to components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotideâ€“ubiquinone oxido-reductase). Beta2.7 specifically binds and prevents re-localization of essential complex I subunit genes associated with retinoid/interferon-induced mortality-19 (GRIMâ€“19), in response to apoptotic stimuli. This interaction is also important for stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential and the mitochondrial ATP production, preventing metabolic dysfunction, which is essential for completion of the virus' life cycle ((Reeves 2007)).

      <annotation section="Characteristics">83-112 nt. Four human Y RNAs (hY1, 112nt; hY3, 101nt; hY4, 93nt; and hY5, 83nt) encoded in single copy genes, which are present in a cluster in human chromosome 7 ((Maraia 1994)). Pyrimidine-rich, transcribed by RNA polymerase III, and contain a 5-triphosphate and a retained 3' poly(U) tail ((Hendrick 1981)).

Y RNAs form characteristic stem-loop structures, with a highly conserved double-stranded stem formed by partially complementary 5' and 3' terminal domains, linked by a loop domain containing secondary stem-loops ((Teunissen 1999), (O'Brien 1993), (van Gelder 1994)). Parts of the RNA structure appear to be flexible, able to adopt different conformations. Y RNAs contain an essential characteristic bulged C in the middle portion of the stem  (in position 8 or 9), as well as the characteristic pyrimidine-rich region that is single-stranded in the secondary structures ((Teunissen 1999), (Green 1998)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">All four Y RNAs are primarily cytoplasmic, they are also detected in perinucleolar compartments, discrete structures near the nucleolar rim ((Matera 1995)).

Y RNAs are expressed in similar levels in all human tissues and cell lines investigated, with all Y RNAs showing a positively correlated expression across different tissue types ((Christov 2008))((Pruijn 1993)). Y RNAs are up-regulated in a number of human solid tumours compared to corresponding nonmalignant tissues. In particular, hY1 and hY3 RNAs are over-expressed in carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the bladder, cervix, colon, kidney, lung and prostate ((Christov 2008)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">The different Y RNAs may have multiple roles.

Y RNAs were identified as the RNA component of the 'small cytoplasmic' (sc) Ro autoantigen (soluble  ribonucleoproteins (RNP) detected in sera of systemic lupus erythematosis patients), binding the autoantigen La and Ro proteins ((Lerner 1981)).

Y RNAs have been shown to be required for semiconservative chromosomal DNA replication in vitro, in a mammalian cell-free experimental system. hY1, hY3, hY4 and hY5 RNAs are functionally redundant ((Christov 2006)), and have been shown to act at the initiation step of DNA replication* ((Krude 2009)). (*See (Krude 2009) for review).

Regulate cell DNA replication and cell proliferation, with knock-down of hY1 and hY3 RNA in human cells causing a cytostatic arrest of cell proliferation ((Christov 2008), (Krude 2009), (Christov 2006)).

Bind to Ro proteins through their terminal stem, which contains conserved binding sites for Ro60 and La proteins ((Green 1998)). The central portion of the double-stranded stem is essential for reconstituting chromosomal DNA replication, while the central loop and the terminal stem are not ((Gardiner 2009)).

Different proteins may also bind Y RNAs or be present in human Ro RNPs, such as hnRNP K, PTB, RoBP1 and nucleolin ((Bouffard 2000), (Fabini 2000), (Fouraux 2002)), indicating that Y RNAs may be involved in their regulation, such as in the control of alternative splicing. hY5 RNA uniquely binds to ribosomal protein L5 and its binding partner 5S RNA, with Ro-Y5 suggested to have a specialized role in 5S ribosomal RNA quality control ((Hogg 2007)). Ro60 protein had been previously shown to bind misfolded small RNAs and suggested to be involved in quality control of the RNAs ((Shi 1996), (Stein 2005), (Fuchs 2006)). A role is also proposed in the regulation of the translation of ribosomal mRNA ((Pellizzoni 1998)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">A single cluster of functional Y RNA genes is preserved throughout tetrapod evolution, which however exhibits clade-specific tandem duplications, gene-losses, and rearrangements ((Mosig 2007)).

Homologues of functional Y RNAs are present throughout vertebrates, with conserved synteny, but numbers vary between species, with individual gene-loss events having occurred during evolution in most classes (the mouse expresses only Y1 and Y3 RNAs, zebrafish only Y1, and chicken Y3 and Y4). No Y RNA gene has been identified in some species such as Drosophila melanogaster and Schistosoma species. ((Copeland 2009), (Pruijn 1993), (Mosig 2007), (Gardiner 2009), (O'Brien 1993), (Perreault 2007), (Farris 1995)). Y3 is the most conserved Ro RNA, not only by its more consistent presence in other species, but also at the levels of sequence divergence and secondary structure similarity ((Farris 1995)). 

Recently, the 'sbRNAs' or stem-bulge RNAs from Caenorhabditis elegans have been identified as homologs of vertebrate Y RNAs present in nematode worms, showing the characteristic Ro protein binding motif ((Boria 2010)).

An Y-like RNA (as well as other small RNAs) has been also identified in the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans binding to an ortholog of Ro60 (Rsr), which accumulate following UV irradiation, and contribute to the resistance to irradiation ((Chen 2000)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Misc">Thousands of Y RNA 'retropseudogenes' are present among various species ((Perreault 2007)). It has been suggested that hY RNAs represent a novel class of nonautonomous, L1-dependent, retrotransposable elements ((Perreault 2005)).</annotation>

CDR1 Natural antisense transcript
Circular RNA sponge for miR-7</annotation>
      <annotation section="Characteristics">Identified as ~1.5kb (no internal splicing) and ~1.3kb (with internal splicing) ((Hansen 2011)). 

Circular transcript in which 5â€™ and 3â€™ ends have splice donor and acceptor sequences and are spliced together ((Hansen 2011)).

Human CDR1 AS contains 1 target site with almost perfect complementarity to miR-671 and 73/74 miR-7 target sites, of which 63 are conserved. The miR-7 sites have seed and 3' base pair matches to miR-7 but also central mismatches, which would be expected to prevent miR-7 mediated cleavage ((Hansen 2013), (Memczak 2013)).

Also contains 2 internal splice sites ((Hansen 2011)).
</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Highly expressed in HEK293 cells where it could potentially bind up to 20 000 miR-7 molecules per cells ((Memczak 2013)).

Highly expressed in human adult and fetal brain and spinal cord. Expression in brain considerably higher than that of CDR1 mRNA. Modest expression in other human tissues including heart, lung, thymus and thyroid ((Hansen 2011)).

Expressed in mouse brain (cerebellum, cerebrum/cerebral cortex, hippocampus, forebain and midbrain) ((Hansen 2011), (Memczak 2013)), with high expression in the neocortex, hippocampus (including the dentate gyrus), thalamus and E13.5 midbrain.  At a tissue level CDR1 AS highly overlaps miR-7 expression ((Hansen 2013), (Memczak 2013)).

Localises to neuronal cell bodies and dendrites ((Hansen 2013)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">First lncRNA identified as a miRNA target ((Hansen 2011)). Acts as a miRNA sponge for miR-7 and miR671 but with different functional outcomes ((Hansen 2011), (Hansen 2013), (Memczak 2013)).

Function in association with miR-7:
CDR1 AS acts as a sponge for miR-7, which can bind to CDR1 AS but not degrade it ((Hansen 2013), (Memczak 2013)). 
CDR1 AS shows high levels of miR-7 and Ago2 association, which causes co-localisation of CDR1 AS to P-bodies ((Hansen 2013), (Memczak 2013)).
CDR1 AS and miR-7 expression patterns are not identical. However co-expression in the same brain cells can be identified in the dentate hilus and different layers of the cingulate gyrus ((Hansen 2013)). The lack of CDR1 AS expression outside the brain makes it possible this is a brain specific interaction and function.
CDR1 AS inhibit miR-7 activity causing depression of some miR-7 targets ((Hansen 2013), (Memczak 2013)).
Expression of human or mouse circular CDR1 AS in developing zebrafish (which have miR-7 but not the CDR1 locus) caused a decrease in midbrain size. This closely mimicked the phenotype of miR-7 knockdown, further supporting CDR1 AS as a biologically relevant miR-7 sponge ((Memczak 2013)).  


Function in association with miR-671: 
CDR1 AS functions to stabilize CDR1 mRNA, as a decrease in CDR1 AS levels leads to a decrease in the expression level of the sense CDR1 mRNA. Conversely, the sense transcript does not act to stabilize the antisense lncRNA and appears to destabilize it, perhaps through a feedback mechanism ((Hansen 2011)).
CDR1 AS and hence CDR1 sense are regulated by miR-671. A conserved miR-671 binding site is present in the antisense transcript (a site which corresponds to near the transcriptional start site of the sense CDR1 mRNA). miR-671 localises to the nucleus and can repress CDR1 AS and CDR1 sense mRNA ((Hansen 2011)).
miR-671 causes Ago2 mediated cleavage and down-regulation of CDR1 AS, likely due to the near perfect complementarity between miR-671 and CDR1 AS ((Hansen 2011)).
Mechanism for how CDR1 AS stabilizes CDR1 is not certain but it does not appear to be due to the lncRNA acting as a miR-671 sponge ((Hansen 2011)).
By down-regulating CDR1 AS miR-671 could potentially indirectly regulate miR-7 and hence the levels of miR-7 target genes ((Hansen 2013)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">CDR1 AS found in eutherian mammals ((Hansen 2011), (Hansen 2013)).

miR-7 targets sites are conserved in eutherian mammals ((Hansen 2013)), with 63 present in a least one other species ((Memczak 2013)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Misc">Note: Evidence of antisense transcription across locus from a number of tissues present in Illumnia Body Atlas (IBA2). These suggest antisense transcripts can extend in both 5â€™ and 3â€™ directions and can be longer than 1.5kb. Whether these represent longer or primary CDR1 AS transcript is unclear.

AK054921 may represent an isoform although the sequence does not reach the miR-671 binding site.</annotation>

      <annotation section="Characteristics">~130 nt. 'Alu-like RNA', it has a canonical Alu/7SL-derived sequence structure. Transcribed by RNA Polymerase III from the first intron of the ASCL3 (Achaete Scute-Like homologue 3) gene ((Castelnuovo 2010)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">NDM29 expression was analyzed in 6 different cell types and found in abundant levels in neural cells (neuroblastoma cell lines SHSY5Y and SKNBE2, and primary culture of human glioma cells), but  at a very low levels in epithelial-derived cells (HeLa, HEK293, and primary cultures of skin fibrobroblast). NDM29 expression was increased in differentiating cells ((Castelnuovo 2010)).

NDM29 RNA was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of SKNBE2 and HeLa cells, but enriched (~70%) in the latter ((Castelnuovo 2010)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">In humans, NDM29 maps in a genomic region whose deletion has been shown to be involved in neuroblastoma development ((De Preter 2005)).

In-vitro over-expression of NDM29 promoted differentiation of neuroblastoma (NB) cells into cells with neuron-like features (including marker expression, morphology,  anchorage-dependent growth and excitatory properties), and a reduction in the tumor initiating ('stem-like') cell fraction in the NB cell population. In-vitro and in-vivo experiments indicated that increased expression of NDM29 restricts NB development and malignancy. It also lead to reduced expression of multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) mRNA in malignant NB cells, and so increased their susceptibility to doxorubicin and cis-platinum antiblastic drugs used in NB therapy ((Castelnuovo 2010)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">RNA was detected in humans - Alu-derived elements are restricted to primate lineage  ((Castelnuovo 2010)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Misc">NDM29 transcript comprises Alu sequences and unique sequences and might have been inserted into the genomic locus by retrotransposition ((Castelnuovo 2010)).

Similar to 21A RNA, it is also a short interspersed nucleotide element, marked as AluJb elements. ((Pagano 2007))

      <annotation section="NULL">hsr omega: heat shock RNA omega</annotation>
      <annotation section="Characteristics">Product of the 93D (or hsr-omega) locus, one of the largest heat-shock puffs in Drosophila polytene chromosomes. This locus produces three major long transcripts (by alternative polyadenylation and splicing) in all Drosophila species examined (reviewed in (Jolly 2006)). The locus spans 10â€“20 kb, composed of two small exons (~475 and 700 bp in Drosophila melanogaster) separated by a 700 bp intron, and followed by a long stretch (5â€“15 kb) of short (280 bp in D. melanogaster) tandem repeat units ((Jolly 2006)).

Long noncoding transcripts produced include three major hsr-omega transcripts, which share the same 5' end ((Bendena 1991), (Garbe 1986)):

Hsr-omega-n (omega-1) is &gt;10kb-long and nuclear transcript that covers the entire length of the gene (including the tandem repeats), is polyadenylated, and retains the intron.

Hsr-omega-c (omega-3 ) is 1.2-kb, spliced and cytoplasmic. 

The third common RNA, omega-pre-c (omega-2) is spliced to produce the mature omega-c transcript. It is 1.9kb-long and terminates at a first polyadenylation site located at the 3' end of exon 2.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Transcripts are constitutively expressed at relatively high levels in many tissues, in almost all cell types analysed, and are developmentally regulated ((Lakhotia 2001))((Bendena 1991))((Mutsuddi 1995)).

Transcripts were not detected in gonadal cell types such as male and female gonial cells and in follicle cells and oocytes in ovary. Polytenised tissues such as salivary glands, and certain regions of larval gut and the Malpighian tubules, showed a greater abundance of hsr-omega transcripts with a strong hybridization in nuclei ((Bendena 1991)). 

Expression is stress-induced, being highly active after heat exposure, but also responsive to other stresses such as amides benzamide and colchicine ((Tapadia 1997)).

Nuclear hsr-omega-n is localized in nuclear granules called omega-speckles ((Sengupta 2006), (Bendena 1991), (Prasanth 2000)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Flies null for Hsr-omega mostly die at embryonic stage, and the surviving flies are weak, sterile and die within a few days of emergence ((Jolly 2006)).

Transcribed from a locus involved in the heat shock response in Drosophila. hsr-omega-n nuclear transcripts form complexes with various hnRNP proteins and related proteins in nucleoplasmic omega-speckles, distributed in the interchromatin space in close proximity to the chromatin ((Sengupta 2006), (Bendena 1991), (Prasanth 2000)).

Many proteins are found associated with the hsr-omega-n transcripts, including: (i) various hnRNPs Hrp40 (hnRNP A), Hrb87F (hnRNP A1/A2), Hrb57A (hnRNP K), Hrb98DE (44); (ii) other nuclear RNA-binding proteins like NonA, PEP, Sxl, nuclear non-histone proteins recognized by Q14, Q16, T29, P75 antibodies; (iii) Snf; (iv) Hsp83 and (v) Tpr (see (Jolly 2006) for review and references).

Omega speckles disappear after heat shock, except from the hsr-omega/93D locus, and speckled distribution of associated hnRNPs is disrupted in hsr-omega nullosomics ((Prasanth 2000)). It is suggested that the ncRNA may regulate the availability of hnRNPs in active (chromatin bound) and inactive (in omega-speckles) compartments and interfere with the processing of pre-mRNAs in cyst cells ((Rajendra 2002)).

Altered expression of the hsr omega RNAs enhances poly-Q-induced neurotoxicity in Drosophila ((Sengupta 2006), (Mallik 2009), (Fernandez-Funez 2000)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">The hsr-omega/93D locus and genomic organization is conserved among Drosophila species. However, the hsr-omega transcripts have poor sequence conservation among different Drosophila species ((Garbe 1986)), but, similar to other ncRNAs, have short stretches of conservation.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Misc">Heat shock puffs in Chironomus genus also produce non-conding transcripts analogous to Drosophila  hsr omega transcripts, and interaction of Hsp90 with puffs is dependent on transcription ((Morcillo 1993)). Analogy is also drawn with non-related human heat-shock induced Satellite III (Sat III) transcripts ((Jolly 2006)).

Natural variation in hsr-omega expression influence rates of protein synthesis in Drosophila lines ((Johnson 2009)).

Small open reading frames (ORFs) present in hsr-omega are poorly conserved in different Drosophila species. A short ORF of 23â€“27 amino acids present in the hsr-omega-c sequence of three examined Drosophila species is translatable, but the predicted protein has not been detected ((Fini 1989)).</annotation>

Analysis in different cell culture lines showed co-expression of DIO3OS transcripts and DIO3 ((Kester 2006)). Conversely differentiation of mature brown adipose tissue (BAT) adipocytes from precursor cells showed that Dio3 was only expressed in the proliferating precursors while a specific Dio3os isoform was expressed only in differentiated adipocytes ((Hernandez 2007)).

Overexpression of ADAMTS9-AS2 upregulates the ADAMTS9 mRNA expression (Yao 2014). DNMT1 is responsible for methylating ADAMTS9-AS2 which is evident by the increased expression of ADAMTS9-AS2 resulting from DNMT1 knockdown (Yao 2014).

      <annotation section="Name">TERRA: telomeric repeat-containing RNAs

TelRNAs: Telomeric RNAs </annotation>
      <annotation section="Characteristics">Heterogeneous sizes (between 100 nt and 9 kb); transcribed from telomeric C-rich strand (RNAs contain UUAGGG repeats) from telomeres, initiating in subtelomeric regions.

Transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Polyadenylated. ((Azzalin 2007), (Schoeftner 2007))</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">TERRA expression is regulated by several mechanisms, especially telomere length. Measured RNA stability indicates a half-life of approximately 2.2 h ((Schoeftner 2007)).

Nuclear-restricted. Detected in different human and rodent cell lines. Levels vary according to developmental stage, cellular stress, tumour differentiation and chromatin structure: very low levels in mouse embryos between days 11.5 and 15.5 of embryonic gestation; higher levels in all adult tissues tested, with highest levels in thymus, kidney and spleen and other tissues with low or no telomerase activity; low levels in cancer cells. ((Azzalin 2007), (Schoeftner 2007))</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">TERRA RNAs remain associated to telomeric chromatin, making them potential components of mammalian telomeres, and proposed involvement in shortening of telomeres.

Telomere length correlates with TERRA levels in immortal cell lines.

TERRA siRNA knock-down caused an increase in telomere dysfunction-induced foci, aberrations in metaphase telomeres, and a loss of histone H3 trimethyl K9 and origin recognition complex (ORC) binding at telomere repeat DNA.

SMG proteins (effectors of nonsense-mediated decay) are enriched at telomeres in vivo and negatively regulate TERRA association with chromatin, protecting chromosome ends from telomere loss ((Azzalin 2007)).

TERRA transcripts inhibit telomerase activity in vitro, therefore suggested to negatively regulate telomere length. Consistent with this hypothesis, TERRA knock-down causes a loss of telomeric DNA repeats.

TERRA transcripts have recently been detected associated with heterochromatin marks typical of telemores (histone H3 trimethyl K9) as well as with different telomere proteins, including telomere repeat factors 1 and 2 (TRF1 and TRF2), subunits of the ORC, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), and members of the DNA-damage-sensing pathway. In particular, TERRA can interact directly with the TRF2 amino-terminal GAR domain and ORC1 to form a stable ternary complex, and ORC1 binding to TRF2 is RNase A sensitive ((Deng 2009)).

Different lines of evidence indicate that TERRA transcripts form a parallel G-quadruplex structure localized to telomere DNA at cell nuclei, and may form an intermolecular G-quadruplex with DNA ((Xu 2008), (Xu 2010)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">TERRA RNAs have been described in different vertebrates ((Schoeftner 2007)) and yeast ((Luke 2008)), and more recently in Arabidopsis ((Vrbsky 2010)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Misc">Telomeric repeat-containing transcripts have been described in Arabidopsis. A portion of these TERRA transcripts are processed into small interfering RNAs, which contribute to the maintenance of telomeric chromatin through promoting methylation of asymmetric cytosines in telomeric (CCCTAAA)(n) repeats. This process relies on the RNA-dependent DNA methylation pathway  ((Vrbsky 2010)).</annotation>

Neat2: Nuclear enriched abundant transcript 2
</annotation>
      <annotation section="Characteristics">Intergenic ~7kb single exon transcript ((Ji 2003), (Hutchinson 2007)).

A conserved tRNA-like sequence at the 3' end is cleaved off and processed to generated a short tRNA-like ncRNA mascRNA (MALAT1-associated small cytoplasmic RNA) ((Wilusz 2008)).

Post transcriptional processing of Malat1 therefore allows two ncRNAs to be created from the one original transcript ((Wilusz 2008)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Both Malat1 and the processed mascRNA transcript are expressed in a wide range of tissues ((Ji 2003), (Hutchinson 2007), (Wilusz 2008)), (Bernard 2010)), ((Ulitsky 2011)). 

Malat1 is highly expressed in the brain. RNA fluorescence in-situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) on adult mouse brain sections showed high expression of nuclear-localized Malat1 transcripts in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and neurons of the substantia nigra and motoneurons, but very low levels in non-neuronal cells ((Bernard 2010)). In the hippocampus and in Purkinje cells, Malat1 was first detected between post-natal day 0 (P0) and P7 and its level increased until P28 ((Bernard 2010)). This high expression appears to come from up-regulation of Malat1 during differentiation, with in-vitro differentiation of neural stem cells showing significant up-regulation of expression in neuronal and glial differentiated progeny ((Mercer 2010)).

Expressed in the nucleus accumbens of normal human brains and upregulated in this brain region in heroin abusers ((Michelhaugh 2010)). 

In neuroblastoma cells Malat1 was up-regulated by the hormone oxytocin ((Koshimizu 2010)). 

Malat1 is up-regulated in a range of cancers ((Ji 2003), (Yamada 2006), (Lin 2006), (Guffanti 2009)).

High expression of Malat1 is associated with metastasis in certain histological subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is predictive of poor prognosis ((Ji 2003)).

Malat1 is up-regulated in placenta previa increta/percreta, a disease characterised by excessive invasion of fetal placental trophoblasts into the uterus  ((Tseng 2009)).


Malat1 is stable in human B cells and Hela and wt MEFs (half-life &gt;7 hrs) but has significantly lower stability in mouse 3T3 and N2A cells. Suggesting differences in Malat1 stability both within and between species ((Friedel 2009), (Bernard 2010), (Clark 2012), (Tani 2012)).


Malat1 localises to SC35 domain nuclear speckles in several cell lines ((Hutchinson 2007)) ((Clemson 2009)). Localisation to nuclear speckles is transcription-dependent, as RNA pol II inhibition promoted re-distribution of Malat1 ncRNA from nuclear speckles to a homogenous nuclear localisation ((Bernard 2010)). Malat1 co-localises with pre-mRNA-splicing factor SF2/ASF and CC3 antigen in the nuclear speckles ((Bernard 2010)).

MALAT1 is enriched in nuclear speckles in interphase cells and concentrates in mitotic interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs, structural analogs of nuclear speckles present in mitotic cells), but unlike Neat1 it is not required for the structural integrity of the nuclear domain ((Tripathi 2010)).

mascRNA derived from Malat1 is transported to the cytoplasm ((Wilusz 2008)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Summary: Malat1 has been found to regulate alternative splicing of endogenous target genes, and it is implicated in cancer and a series of molecular and cellular phenotypes, as indicated below.


Identified as an oncogene that promotes tumorigensis. Expression of a Malat1 fragment in NIH 3T3 cells transformed cells ((Li 2009)). 

Knockdown inhibited cell mobility and lead to decreased expression of several genes (CTHRC1, CCT4, HMMR, or ROD1) that promoted cell migration ((Tano 2010)). This result may also explain why knockdown inhibited trophoblast-like cell invasion in-vitro, with MALAT1 hypothesised to regulate the level of trophoblast invasion into the uterus in vivo ((Tseng 2009)).

MALAT1 depletion resulted in aberrant mitosis, with a large fraction of cells accumulating at G2/M boundary, and increased cell death ((Tripathi 2010)).

Depletion of Malat1 in neuroblastoma cells indicated that Malat1 affects the expression of genes involved not only in the organization and the function of the nucleus, but also in synapse function and dendrite development. In cultured hippocampal neurons, knock-down of Malat1 decreased synaptic density, whereas its over-expression resulted in a cell-autonomous increase in synaptogenesis ((Bernard 2010)).

There is a significant enrichment for SRSF1 (SF2/ASF) binding sites within the 5' half of both human and mouse MALAT1, whose direct interaction has been demonstrated, and is dependent on its canonical RRM (RRM1) or the pseudo RRM (RRM2) domains ((Sanford 2009), (Tripathi 2010)). Independent sequence elements in MALAT1 influence its distribution to nuclear speckles and the recruitment of SRSF1 ((Tripathi 2010)).

Additional interactions have been found between MALAT1 and SRSF1, SRSF2, and SRSF3 proteins, but only weak interactions with SRSF5 and PSP1 (an RNA-binding protein that is a component of paraspeckles) have been identified ((Tripathi 2010)).

Knock-down of nuclear Malat1 in a transfected U2OS cell line showed that it modulates the recruitment of SR proteins (SRSF1 or SF2/ASF and SC35) to a transcriptionally active transgene array (stably integrated), indicating a role in the regulation of the association of pre-mRNA-splicing factors to transcription sites and control of post-transcriptional gene expression ((Bernard 2010)). Malat1 modulates the speckle association of a subset of pre-mRNA splicing factors, such as SF1, U2AF-65, SF3a60, and B-U2snRNP ((Tripathi 2010)).

Malat1-depleted HeLa cells show increased cellular levels of dephosphorylated SRSF1 (SF2/ASF) ((Bernard 2010)), as well as a moderately increased cytoplasmic pool of poly(A)+ RNA ((Tripathi 2010)). It has recently been shown to regulate alternative splicing of endogenous target genes by modulating SR splicing factor phosphorylation, affecting their levels and the distribution and ratio of phosphorylated to dephosphorylated pools ((Tripathi 2010)).

      <annotation section="Characteristics">DHFR upstream transcripts initiate from an upstream minor promoter of the DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase) gene and extend from approximately 400 nucleotide upstream of the 5'-untranslated region of DHFR (which corresponds to DHFR major/core promoter), to the second intron of the DHFR gene where they terminate ((Masters 1985), (Martianov 2007)). Therefore, the region located between minor and major transcript initiation sites (~400 bp) corresponds to a noncoding transcript and is a promoter of DHFR.

Discrete DHRF upstream initiating transcripts of diverse sizes have been reported, including five major discrete species with sizes of 4.3, 3.8, 3.1, 2.1, and 1.0 kb and four minor ones with sizes of 7.3, 5.0, 1.4, and 0.8kb. Primarily in the poly(A)+ fraction ((Masters 1985)).

DHFR upstream transcripts adopt a series of structures in vitro that are dependent on the G-tract encompassed in its sequence ((Blume 2002)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Enriched in the nucleus ((Masters 1985)).

At least six minor 5' ends mapping upstream of the DHFR gene correspond to approximately 1% of the DHFR-specific polysomal polyA RNA. Most of these species have been found in 6A3 cells, VA2-B cells (the parental line of 6A3), and in HeLa cells ((Masters 1985)).

DHFR upstream transcripts accumulate in a population of serum-starved, contact-inhibited (quiescent) U2OS cells, in which the levels of DHFR mRNA are markedly reduced ((Martianov 2007)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Initial studies indicated that DHFR upstream transcripts could impair the formation of the preinitiation complex (PIC) on the major promoter in vitro, thereby repressing the transcriptional activity of the major DHFR promoter ((Blume 2002)). DHFR upstream transcripts were shown to inhibit transcription from the DHFR core promoter in-trans in a concentration-dependent manner in in-vitro runoff transcription assays. Transcription factor binding sites positioned between the minor and major promoters within the DHFR gene were indicated to be affected by the upstream regulatory transcripts, which selectively sequestered transcription factor Sp3, and to a lesser extent Sp1, preventing their binding to the DHRF core promoter. The sequestration of Sp3 and Sp1 by the DHFR upstream transcripts appears to involve an altered conformation of the RNA, and a structural domain of the protein distinct from that required for binding DNA ((Blume 2002)). However, in-vitro experiments confirmed that transcription from the major promoter could be suppressed in-trans in the absence of Sp1 or any other upstream activating sequence ((Akoulitchev 1995), (Martianov 2007)).

A more recent study demonstrated that these promoter associated transcripts act as interfering transcripts, directly interacting with TFIIB and dissociate the PIC efficiently to repress DHFR expression ((Martianov 2007)). Transcription of the regulatory RNA in trans has a repressive effect on the major DHFR promoter only when the transcript contained the sequence of the core major DHFR promoter ((Martianov 2007)). In addition, the major DHFR promoter is GC-rich and contains several G-track sequences ((Blume 2002)), and specific and stable triplex structures have been shown to form between the DHFR upstream transcripts and the major promoter, which may contribute to promoter targeting and repression in vivo ((Martianov 2007)) ((Blume 2002)).

A comparison of in-vitro transcription from templates containing DHFR minor, major or both promoters in their original sequential order indicated very low transcriptional activity when the minor promoter preceded the major one, but robust transcription from the major promoter, suggesting that transcriptional interference in-cis may also play a role in DHFR inhibition by DHFR upstream transcripts ((Martianov 2007)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Misc">Unpublished analysis of the epigenetic effects of DHFR upstream transcripts indicated similarities to epigenetic markers associated with transcriptional gene silencing induced by the targeted application of synthetic antigene RNAs complementary to the promoter regions of mammalian genes ((Martianov 2007)).

DHFR is the major target of methotrexate, a key component in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment. DNA variations of major promoter/noncoding transcript region and specifc haplotype subtypes involving this region have been associated with childhood ALL, including associations with high-risk patients and lower event-free survival. One particular haplotype (Haplotype *1b) is associated with higher DHFR expression ((Al-Shakfa 2009)).</annotation>

      <annotation section="Characteristics">Expressed from a bi-directional promoter with the protein-coding gene Znfx1. Zfas1 5, is antisense to 5, of Znfx1.

Spliced, polyadenylated. 

SnoRNA host gene, contains 3 intronic C/D box snoRNAs.

Human orthologue is alternatively spliced. </annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Highly expressed and differentially expressed during mammary development. Strongly down-regulated during lactation compared to pregnancy and then up-regulated again during involution. Znfx1 coding gene,in contrast, was more lowly expressed and was not differentially expressed during mammary gland development.

Expressed in the epithelial cells of the mammary gland ducts and alveoli.

Zfas1 is widely expressed in mouse tissues including brain, liver, lung, kidney, spleen, heart and embryo, showing higher expression than Znfx1.

Zfas1 extremely stable with a half life of &gt;32 hrs in N2A (neuroblastoma) cells. Compared to a half life of 50 minutes for Znfx1. The increased stability of Zfas1 may explain why its expression level is much higher than Znfx1. However, in mouse 3T3 and embryonic stem cells Zfas1 stability was much lower with a half-life of 1.7 hr and 63 min respectively, while the human ZFAS1 had a half-life of 3 hr in B-cells ((Friedel 2009), (Sharova 2008), (Clark 2012)). These results suggest there is significant regulation of Zfas1 stability both within and between species ((Clark 2012)).

      <annotation section="Function">Positively regulates level of Atxn7 mRNA and protein (in mouse cell culture). Both Lnc-SCA7 and Atxn7 have conserved MREs for miR-124, by competing for miR-124, Lnc-SCA7 regulates the level of Atxn7.

Atnx7 is a member of the STAGA transcriptional activation complex. Lnc-SCA7 also positively regulates the expression level of many other members of the STAGA complex with which it shares MREs, including for miR-124. Nb: Would hypothesise this regulation is a mix of direct and indirect effects.

Feedback loop: STAGA transcriptional activation complex, (of which Atxn7 is a member) transcriptionally activates miR-124. Lnc-SCA7 regulates levels of many STAGA complex RNAs, likely by competing for miRNAs, preventing them from inhibiting Atnx7 and other STAGA component RNAs.

In spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) this feedback loop is broken (results from fibroblasts derived from human patients and a mouse models of SCA7). The polyQ-repeat expansion in ATXN7 leads to less active STAGA, lower miR-124 levels and increased levels of Lnc-SCA7 and the abnormal ATXN7 in brain tissue. It is hypothesised this occurs in the brain because this is the tissue where the lncRNA, microRNA and ATXN7 are most highly expressed and therefore the loss of miR-124 repression could lead to disease by allowing the accumulation of sufficient levels of abnormal ATXN7 protein . 

Function does not require 97 a.a ORF suggesting Lnc-SCA7 function is RNA directed.

Summary: Through crosstalk with miR-124 and other miRNAs, Lnc-SCA7 regulates the level of ATNX7 and other members of the STAGA transcriptional activation complex.</annotation>

In mice, H19 is activated in extra-embryonic cell types at the time of implantation.

Can be found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm ((Runge 2000), (Schoenfelder 2007), (Brannan 1990)). </annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Complex functions: 

Influences growth via control of Igf2 expression, with a H19 knockout showing an overgrowth phenotype due in part to bi-allelic expression of Igf2 ((Ripoche 1997)).

Can also function in trans to downregulate the expression of a number of imprinted genes in the hypothesised Imprinted Gene Network (IGN) including Igf2r, Dlk1 etc. Allowing H19 to regulate growth during development ((Gabory 2009)).

Implicated as both a tumor suppressor ((Hao 1993), (Yoshimizu 2008)) and an oncogene upregulated by c-myc and hypoxia ((Matouk 2007), (Barsyte-Lovejoy 2006) and references therein). A number of reports have also shown upregulation / reactivation of H19 in various cancers although the functional significance (if any) is unclear in many cases ((Gabory 2010), (Adriaenssens 1998)).


The mode of action by which H19 functions is still unclear: 

Focusing on its regulation of Igf2, H19 has been hypothesised to act at the level of transcription since an H19 knockout lead to methylation changes and loss of imprinting of Igf2 ((Ripoche 1997), FornÃ© (1997)). However, H19 can bind Igf2 mRNA binding-protein (IMP) family members ((Runge 2000)), which appear to act to promote translation of Igf2 ((Hansen 2004), (Liao 2005)), therefore competition between Igf2 and H19 for IMP1 binding may allow H19 to regulate Igf2 post-transcriptionally.

Both sense and antisense transcripts from the H19 locus were identified as binding to the PRC2 chromatin modification complex in mouse embryonic stem cells, suggesting a potential function for H19 RNA ((Zhao 2010)).

miR-675 may be responsible for the oncogenic activity of H19 as it was found to down-regulate the tumour suppressor retinoblastoma (RB) in human colorectal cancer, causing increased tumour cell growth ((Tsang 2009)). Also, in adult human chondrocytes, expression of H19 (and subsequently miR-675) is driven by SOX9 with miR-675 acting to positively regulate COL2A1 which encodes a collagen protein important to the cartilage matrix ((Dudek 2010)).


H19 appears to be a bi-functional RNA acting as both a miRNA and a lncRNA. Such properties may help to explain the conflicting reports that it is both a tumour suppressor and an oncogene ((Smits 2008)). Additionally its effect on tumour development may be heavily context dependent ((Gabory 2010)). </annotation>

GAL10-ncRNA stability was tested, half life ~8 min (relatively stable for a yeast transcript) and targeted for degredation by the TRAMP / exosome complexes.

Steady state expression level ~0.07 transcripts per cell / ~ 1 transcript per 14 cells.

</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Summary: GAL10-ncRNA enhances repression of GAL10 and GAL1 expression when yeast are growing in repressive nutrient conditions.

Transcription of GAL10 ncRNA causes changes in chromatin. 
- H3 K36 me3 is deposited over the chromosomal region GAL10-ncRNA is transcribed from.
- GAL10 transcription also causes a decrease in some histone 3 acetlyation.

GAL10 ncRNA acts in cis, recruiting the Rpd3S HDAC complex. Unknown if GAL10 ncRNA can physically recruit any chromatin modifying complexes or if transcription dependent chromatin changes independent of the GAL10-ncRNA sequence are responsible.

Note: this is not a transcriptional interference mechanism (see infrequent GAL10-ncRNA trancription) but a chromatin modification mechanism.</annotation>

      <annotation section="Characteristics">Originally described as a ~6-kb transcript that initiates in the intergenic region between the alpha and beta myosin heavy chain (MHC) genes, ~2 kb downstream of the beta-MHC gene and transcribed across the entire gene in the antisense orientation ((Haddad 2003)).

Natural antisense transcripts in the MHC cluster have been described forming three major products in rats, antisense to MHC IIa, IIx, and IIb genes. These antisense RNAs are named aII, xII, and bII NATs, respectively ((Pandorf 2006)). The aII NAT begins in the IIa-IIx intergenic region in close proximity to the IIx promoter, extends across the 27-kb IIa MHC gene, and continues to the IIa MHC gene promoter ((Pandorf 2006)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Expressed in cardiac muscle development ((Haddad 2007)). Increasingly expressed following birth or in response to increases in T3 (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine) thyroid hormone.

Expression is inversely correlated with beta-MHC levels: for example, expression of the antisense beta MHC RNA under altered thyroid state and in diabetes directly correlates with that of the alpha MHC mRNA, but negatively correlates with beta mRNA expression ((Haddad 2003)). 

Negative correlation has also been observed between the beta MHC mRNA expression and the antisense beta-RNA in response to aortic constriction-induced pressure overload, in which the beta-MHC gene is up-regulated while the alpha-MHC gene is down-regulated ((Haddad 2006)).

Expression of MHC &quot;aII&quot; antisense is also up-regulated in muscles after spinal cord isolation (SI) in rats, and was negatively correlated with MHC IIa expression and positively correlated with MHC IIx gene expression ((Pandorf 2006)).</annotation>

Segments only a small distance downstream from the TEA promoter are activated while segments more distal are repressed, with alterations in histone modifications and chromatin accessibility ((Abarrategui 2006), (Abarrategui 2007)).

These effects target initial recombination events to the active proximal J segments. In the absence of TEA ncRNA transcription recombination occurs in more distal J segments which are normally repressed ((Abarrategui 2006), (Abarrategui 2007)).

Repressive effects of the TEA ncRNA suggested to be due to transcriptional interference. Unknown if TEA ncRNA also has a function itself, ie: recruitment of chromatin modification complexes ((Abarrategui 2006), (Abarrategui 2007)).</annotation>

      <annotation section="Characteristics">Gene located at 5â€™ end of HoxA cluster, bidirectional transcript with HOXA13 ((Sasaki 2007)).

~3.8kb, transcript in human, spliced and polyadenylated ((Wang 2011)).

~2.3kb transcript in mouse, different splice isoforms, currently known transcripts initiate downstream from the syntenic site in human. </annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Shows collinear regulation of expression like HOX protein coding genes ((Sasaki 2007)).

Has bivalent chromatin marks (both H3 K4me3 and H3 K27me3) whether expression off or on, but only expressed in more distal cells ((Wang 2011)).

Has a similar expression profile to HOXA13, expressed in colon, prostate, placenta and uterus, as well as hand, foreskin and foot fibroblasts ((Sasaki 2007), (Sasaki 2007), (Wang 2011)). Mouse E13.5 in-situs gave similar results ((Wang 2011)).

Nuclear localised, generally to a single small nuclear spot ((Wang 2011)).

Lowly expressed, estimated at ~0.3 copies/cell in expressing tissues ((Wang 2011)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Summary:
Controls activation of 5â€™ HOXA genes. Chromosomal lopping bring it into close association with 5â€™ gene loci. HOTTIP binds WDR5 and recruits a MLL chromatin modifiying complex to maintain a domain of active chromatin over the 5â€™ of HOXA cluster ((Wang 2011)). 

- HOTTIP controls activation of 5â€™ HOXA genes in mammals and chicken. 
- Impact on HOXA genes decreases with increased genomic distance from HOTTIP.
- Phenotypic impact in chicken forelimb of HOTTIP knockdown was shorter than normal distal bones. 

- HOTTIP doesnâ€™t affect chromosomal structure and looping but it was necessary for maintenance of H3 K4me3 chromatin marks over the distally expressed 5â€™ half of the HOXA locus. HOTTIP RNA binds WDR5 a component of MLL/Trithorax complexes recruiting a MLL complex to lay down H3 K4me3 marks.
- WDR5 binding mediated by sequence(s) in 5â€™ 1kb of HOTTIP. 

HOTTIP appears to act in cis, its function is facilitated by the chromosomal looping that brings it into close proximity with 5â€™ HOXA genes. </annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">Present in human and mouse. Portions of HOXA13as sequence are well conserved throughout mammals ((Wang 2011)). 

Appears to be present in chicken although there is little homology ((Wang 2011)).

RNA contains some highly conserved sequences which are predicted to form a conserved structure ((Sasaki 2007)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Misc">Background: Hox genes are found in 4 clusters. Genes in each cluster are expressed in certain tissues along body axes dependent on their position in the cluster. In the HoxA cluster genes near the 5â€™ are expressed in more distal tissues while genes near the 3â€™ are expressed in more proximal tissues.

Expressed genes have active chromatin marks and show close physical association (likely due to chromosomal looping). Inactive genes do not associate and have repressive chromatin marks ((Wang 2011)).

      <annotation section="Characteristics">Northern blot with a probe for Nespas detects a smear and discrete band of 4.4kb and larger ((Wroe 2000)). In addition to an unspliced form, five alternatively spliced forms of up to 1.4 kb in length have also been detected ((Williamson 2002)).

Imprinted (transcribed from the paternal allele). Transcribed from intron 2 of Nesp (Gnas), encompassing exons 2 through 1. The imprinted GNAS locus encodes the alpha-subunit of the stimulatory G protein as well as additional imprinted transcripts including the maternally expressed NESP55 and other paternally expressed transcripts (XLalphas and A/B transcripts).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Tissue-specific expression with signal in heart, in cerebral cortex, adrenal, and spleen, where Nesp is also expressed. Nesp and Nespas transcripts show expression from opposite parental alleles in most (but not all) tissues ((Li 2000)), and Nespas may be abundant in some tissues where Nesp is not detected ((Williamson 2002)). Furthermore, the Nesp transcripts can also remain imprinted in tissues that lack Nespas.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">A 4.2 kb microdeletion in humans that ablates two GNAS antisense exons is associated with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib.  When maternally transmitted, this mutation causes loss of maternal GNAS imprints, partial gain of NESP55 methylation, and resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH) in affected and obligate carrier individuals. Paternal transmission leads to epigenetic alterations in cis, including a partial loss of NESP55 methylation and a partial gain of A/B methylation. ((Chillambhi 2010))

Nespas RNA was identified as binding to the repressive PRC2 chromatin modification complex in mouse embryonic stem cells, suggesting that like noncoding RNAs from other imprinted region, nespas could act to regulate the imprinting cluster it is transcribed from ((Zhao 2010)).  </annotation>

      <annotation section="Name">RN7SK: RNA, 7SK small nuclear</annotation>
      <annotation section="Characteristics">~330 nt in vertebrates*. Transcribed by RNAP III, GC-rich sequence forming conserved secondary structures  (especially 3' and 5' stem-loop motifs).

7SK RNA is capped at its 5' end by BCDIN3, a specific methylase methylphosphate capping enzyme (MePCE) ((Jeronimo 2007)). 

RNAP II was recently found to bind near 7SK promoter, as well as many other known Pol III genes, suggesting that RNAP II may also play a role in regulating their transcription ((Raha 2010)).

*In invertebrates, 7SK homologs may have different sizes (such as &gt;400 nt and ~130 nt in drosophilids and nematodes, respectively). ((Gruber 2008)) ((Marz 2009))</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Nuclear, highly abundant (one of the most abundant small RNAs in vertebrate cells), first isolated from HeLa nuclear extracts, but ubiquitously expressed.

RNA sequencing from 11 humans tissues confirmed ubiquitous high expression of 7SK with expression in some tissues being higher than any mRNA ((Castle 2010)). </annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Controls RNAP II activity by inhibiting P-TEFb elongation factor, which is a cdk-cyclin kinase that functions as both a general and an HIV-1 Tat-specific transcription factor ((Nguyen 2001)) ((Yang 2001)), with an impact on cell growth and differentiation.

7SK snRNA is a central scaffold that coordinates protein-protein interactions and, by inhibiting P-TEFb kinase-mediated CTD phosphorylation, regulates RNAP II elongation ((Nguyen 2001)). 7SK snRNP (composed of 7SK snRNA, Hexim1, Larp7/Pip7S, and the P-TEFb subunits CycT1 and Cdk9) is not only critical for controlling transcription, but also for regulating alternative splicing coupled to transcription elongation ((Barboric 2009)). It is also essential for vertebrate development ((Barboric 2009)). The 3' end of HIC mRNA has full activity and contains a predicted structure resembling the 3'-terminal hairpin of 7SK that is critical for P-TEFb binding ((Barboric 2009)).

7SK has been found highly enriched in isolated chromatin fractions, which may be related to its role in transcriptional regulation ((Mondal 2010)).

At an early stage of the HIV transcription cycle, elongation is prevented as P-TEFb is recruited to the HIV-1 promoter in a catalytically inactive state bound to the 7SK snRNP and also the Tat trans-activator of transcription protein. The inhibitory 7SK snRNP may be displaced by the nascent TAR HIV RNA that also binds Tat protein, activating P-TEFb kinase and transcriptional elongation ((D'Orso 2010)). Displacement of 7SK may also be performed by cellular RNAs, as indicated by the 3'-untranslated region (~300-nt) of HIC mRNA, which forms complexes with P-TEFb and is necessary and sufficient for stimulation of P-TEFb-dependent transcription of the HIV promoter ((Young 2007)).

7SK RNA also inhibits APOBEC3C deaminase activity and sequesters it to the nucleolus, suggesting broader role for 7SK RNA in regulating key nuclear functions ((He 2007)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">Highly conserved throughout jawed vertebrates (but in lamprey it differs in 32% of its sequence from the mammalian 7SK (GÃ¼rsoy (2000))), and has a few conserved sequence and structure motifs over longer evolutionary distances.

More recently, it has also been detected in arthropods, showing that two highly structured conserved domains (5'- and 3'-stem regions) were present in the bilaterian ancestor ((Gruber 2008)), and even in nematode Caenorhabditis species ((Marz 2009)).</annotation>

      <annotation section="Characteristics">~300 nt, transcribed by RNAPIII. 

The eukaryotic small cytoplasmic 7SL is an RNA component of the SRP (signal recognition particle), which associates with the ribosome and targets nascent proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum for secretion or membrane insertion ((Walter 1982)) ((Zwieb 2004)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Ubiquitously expressed at high levels. Localises to the cytoplasm. An expression profile from 11 human tissues using RNA sequencing showed 7SL was most highly expressed ncRNA and could be an order of magnitude more highly expressed than any mRNA ((Castle 2010)). </annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">7SL RNA is required for structural and functional properties of SRP ((Walter 1982)), being a scaffold component upon which the six proteins of the SRP bind in higher eukaryotes. In mammals SRP consists of the SRP RNA the six proteins named SRP9, SRP14, SRP19, SRP54, SRP68, and SRP72 ((Walter 1983)).

Bacterial SRP has a much reduced complexity, consisting of a small SRP RNA (4.5S RNA) and a homolog of protein SRP54, also called Ffh or P48 ((Bernstein 1993)). In archaea only two SRP proteins, SRP19 and SRP54, are thought to be part of the SRP, although SRP RNA closely resembles the mammalian homolog ((Bhuiyan 2000)).

There is evidence that a highly conserved region of 7SL RNA catalyses the binding of SRP to its receptor SR, and that this RNA stimulates the GTPase activities of the SRP-SR complex ((Zhang 2008)) ((Siu 2006)) ((Peluso 2000)).</annotation>

A full length clone has not been identified so the presence of splicing is unknown.

      <annotation section="Expression">Widely expressed in adult tissues and over embryonic development ((Coccia 1992)).

Transcript undergoes post-transcriptional regulation, highly unstable but stabilised by growth arrest, serum starvation and inhibition of protein synthesis ((Coccia 1992), (Smith 1998), (Kino 2010)). Associates with ribosomes in the cytoplasm ((Smith 1998)).

Localises to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm ((Kino 2010)).

Down-regulated in breast cancer ((Mourtada-Maarabouni 2008)).

Transcript was classified as unstable with a half-life &gt;4 hr in human Hela cells ((Tani 2012)). Similar half-lives were identified in human B cells and mouse 3T3 fibroblasts ((Friedel 2009), (Clark 2012)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Necessary and sufficient for growth arrest in human peripheral blood T-cells. Functions by  controlling apoptosis and the cell cycle in lymphocytes ((Mourtada-Maarabouni 2008)).

In some cell lines certain Gas5 isoforms act to sensitise the cells to apoptosis but can't induce apoptosis on their own. In other cells types Gas5 can both induce apoptosis and growth arrest and sensitise the cells to further apoptosis ((Mourtada-Maarabouni 2008)).

Gas5 can be regulated by mTOR, with mTOR (which promotes cellular proliferation) acting to inhibit the function of Gas5 ((Mourtada-Maarabouni 2010)).

Gas5 carries out its function by binding the DNA binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) with a sequence that mimmics the glucocorticoid response element (GRE). Gas5 is translocated into the nucleus bound to the GR where it prevents GR from binding GREs and regulating transcription of target genes including apoptosis inhibitors ((Kino 2010)).

Gas5 also appears to repress the action of many steroid hormone receptors, showing some similarities to another lncRNA SRA ((Kino 2010)).

Gas5 is a snoRNA host and a functional RNA. Function does not require putative but nonconserved ORF, or the intronic snoRNAs ((Mourtada-Maarabouni 2008), (Mourtada-Maarabouni 2008), (Kino 2010)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">Gas5 in mouse and human do not show high sequence identity ((Tanaka-Fujita 2007)) although the GRE mimmic region is conserved ((Kino 2010)).

Most of the snoRNAs found in human Gas5 also cluster in the same order in a putatively noncoding RNA host gene in chicken. 42% homology was found between human Gas5 and the chicken gene which was named Gas5-like ((Shao 2009)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Misc">Mourtada-Maarabouni., et al (2010) provide an interesting hypothesis for how Gas5 levels and therefore function is regulated.
- Gas5 is stabilised by inhibition of protein synthesis suggesting it may normally be a target for nonsense mediated decay (NMD). mTOR regulates 5' TOP genes (which includes Gas5) promoting translation, whereas mTOR inhibition inhibits translation. This could allow mTOR to inhibit Gas5 by promoting Gas5 NMD. 

This suggests that since Gas5 is known to be functional at the RNA level, any Gas5 translation may be a regulatory to control Gas5 levels and not necessarily to produce a functional protein.  </annotation>

      <annotation section="Expression">Highly expressed during EBV latency in infection of many cell types and all associated human malignancies (EBERs are the most abundantly expressed RNAs during latency).

      <annotation section="Function">Bind to La autoantigen protein ((Rosa 1981), (Lerner 1981)) and PKR in vitro, and have been suggested to block PKR activity and confer resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis of host cells ((Clarke 1991), (Sharp 1993), (Nanbo 2005)), although inhibition of PKR has not been observed in vivo ((Ruf 2005)).

EBER-1 interacts with RPL22 (ribosomal protein L22), which is known to interact with components of different viruses ((Dobbelstein 1995), (Fok 2006)). EBER-1 mediates stable relocalisation of L22 from nucleoli to nucleoplasm in EBV-infected cells, which is critical for EBER-dependent functions ((Houmani 2009)). Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells expressing mutated EBER-1 RNAs incapable of binding L22 have reduced capacity to enhance BL cell growth ((Houmani 2009)).

Role in the growth and maintenance of BL cell malignant phenotype ((Shimizu 1994), (Ruf 2000)). Also contribute to the growth of other B-cell lymphoma-, gastric carcinoma-, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma-derived cell lines ((Iwakiri 2003), (Iwakiri 2004), (Yamamoto 2000)).

Inhibit alpha interferon-induced apoptosis in latently infected B-cell lines. EBER RNAs induce the expression of interleukin (IL)-10 in BL cells ((Kitagawa 2000)), as well as insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 in gastric carcinoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, and IL-9 in T cells, which acts as an autocrine growth factor.

EBERs can be secreted from EBV-infected cells and can be detected in the sera of infected patients. RNAs are recognized by toll-like receptor (TLR)3, leading to induction of type-I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines ((Iwakiri 2009)), suggesting that activation of TLR3 signaling could lead to the pathogenesis of active EBV infectious diseases ((Iwakiri 2009), (Iwakiri 2010)).

Functionality of EBER1 and 2 does not appear to be redundant, as transforming capacity of EBER2-deleted virus is comparable to that of EBV lacking both EBERs, but that of EBER-1-deleted virus is as high as wild-type EBV, indicating that EBER1 does not play a critical role in EBV-induced B-cell growth transformation.

      <annotation section="Characteristics">~3.8 kb. Antisense to Dlx6 genes in the Dlx5/6 cluster. Evf1 and 2 are isoforms with alternative promoters expressed from ultraconserved enhancers. Different Evf-1 and Evf-2 transcripts result from alternative transcription initiation, alternative splicing of exon 3, and alternative polyadenylation. Therefore, Evf-1 and Evf-2 cDNA sequences have unique 5' and 3' ends, and share a 2561bp region of identity ((Feng 2006), (Kohtz 2004)).

A large (7.5-kb) non-polyadenylated form recognized by both Evf-1 and Evf-2 Northern blot probes is present in the total RNA fraction and absent from the poly(A) containing fraction. The Evf-2-specific probe also identifies a smaller (500-bp) transcript ((Feng 2006)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Nuclear localisation ((Feng 2006), (Sone 2007)).

Similar expression pattern to Dlx6 and Dlx5 mRNAs. Developmentally regulated, expressed in the ventral forebrain. Detected in immature neurons as they exit the ventricular zone ((Feng 2006)).

Ectopic expression of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) induces the expression of Evf-2, Evf-1, Dlx-2, Dlx-5, and Dlx-6 in the dorsal telencephalon in vivo (mouse embryos)  ((Feng 2006)).

Up-regulated in vitro during differentiation of neuronal progenitors to GABAergic neurons and during mouse embryonic stem cells differentiation ((Dinger 2008)) ((Mercer 2010)). Also found co-expressed in the first and second branchial arches of E10.5 mouse embryos ((Jeong 2008)).

Brain expression of Evf2 and Evf1 is dependent on Dlx1/2 function. Expression of Evf2 and Evf1 is also greatly reduced in Dlx5/6, and Dlx5 or Dlx6, knock-out mutants, indicating that they may be their direct or indirect regulatory targets ((Kohtz 2004), (Jeong 2008)). Evf1 and Evf2 were more down-regulated in Dlx5-/- than in Dlx6-/- mutants ((Jeong 2008)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Evf-2 ncRNA and Dlx-2 proten display an intranuclear colocalization ((Feng 2006)).

The ultraconserved region* of Evf-2 binds and co-operates with Dlx-2 in vivo to increase the transcriptional activity of the Dlx-5/6 enhancer in a target and homeodomain-specific manner ((Feng 2006)). *The Evf-2 5' region is both necessary and sufficient for activity.

Evf2 recruitment of DLX2 and MECP2 controls the expression of targets Dlx5, Dlx6 and Gad1 through trans and cis-acting mechanisms in developing ventral forebrain. Evf2 function is also required for proper gene regulation and formation of hippocampal GABA-dependent neuronal circuitry in mouse adult brain ((Bond 2009)).

MECP2 transcriptional repression ofÂ Evf2Â and Dlx5, but not Dlx6, occurs through antagonism of DLX1/2 in E13.5 MGE (Kohtz 2014).

Evf2 prevents site-specific CpG DNA methylation of Dlx5/6ei in trans, without altering Dlx5/6 expression (Kohtz 2014).

Evf2 inhibits enhancer DNA methylation, effectively modulating competition between the DLX1/2 activator and MECP2 repressor (Kohtz 2014).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">Evf-2 is transcribed from (and contains in its first exon) a vertebrate ultraconserved element. Analysis of transcripts by isolation from a cDNA library (rat), RTâ€“PCR (zebrafish and chicken), or expressed sequence tag (EST) databases (human and mouse) showed that transcription of the ultraconserved element associated with Evf-2 (enhancer ei) is conserved in vertebrates ((Feng 2006)).

Evf-1 and Evf-2 exhibit a high degree (86%â€“93%) of conservation between rat and mouse sequences in their 5' and 3' regions, and a compilation of transcripts found in human, rat, mouse, zebrafish, and chicken shows that only transcription from exon 2 is conserved ((Feng 2006)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Misc">Evf-2 is proposed to belong to a class of transcription regulating, ultraconserved ncRNAs (trucRNAs), and may be part of a broader Dlx gene/antisense RNA regulatory network ((Feng 2006), (Dinger 2008)).</annotation>

      <annotation section="Name">Khps1a : Sphk1a antisense transcript</annotation>
      <annotation section="Characteristics">1290 nt*; originates from the CpG island and overlaps a &quot;tissue-dependent differentially methylated region&quot; (T-DMR) of Sphk1. Single-exon, 5'-capped and 3'-polyadenylated, it spans the region -2095 to -3384 in relation to the commonly used +1 translation start site for Sphk1 subtypes, which covers the entire region of the T-DMR (-3233 to -3023) and the alternative first exons of both Sphk1a and -c ((Imamura 2004)).

*Northern blot with probes for Khps1 also indicates the presence of transcripts with different sizes (600-20,000nt).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Expression of Khps1 is detected in many tissues, with high levels in the kidney and only weakly expressed in the liver and brain. Expression was detected in the cytoplasm of primary cell culture from rat  fetuses, as well as nuclei in some cells, indicating that Khps1 is exported to the cytoplasm ((Imamura 2004)).

Similar to Sphk1, the expression of Khps1 is also detected from only one allele (demonstrating that it is also imprinted), and Khps1 and Sphk1 show mutually exclusive expression in individual cells ((Imamura 2004)).

Identified as a PROMPT (promoter upstream transcript) which are degraded by the exosome and generally highly unstable ((Preker 2008)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Regulates DNA methylation in the T-DMR of Sphk1 promoter ((Imamura 2004); (Preker 2008)). In vitro over-expression of two fragments of Khps1 in NRK cells cause demethylation of CG sites of the T-DMR, but which is accompanied of DNA methylation at three CC(A/T)GG sites ((Imamura 2004)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">Rat Khps1a exhibits 88.7% and 56.2% nucleotide sequence identity with corresponding DNA sequences in the genome databases at NCBI for human and mouse  (Accession Nos. NT_1010641 and NT_039521), respectively ((Imamura 2004)).

ESTs overlapping Sphk1 T-DMR CpG island in mouse, homologous to the CpG island of rat Sphk1, are described (mouse EST AA796730 shows 87% similarity with the CpG island of rat  Sphk1). Human transcripts in the region were also detected by RT-PCR in HEK293 and HeLa cells ((Imamura 2004)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Misc">There are possible open reading frames in Khps1a, in which the maximal size is 306 bp, but no recognizable amino acid motifs or domains in the possible proteins were found, and three possible start codons in the rat  Khps1a aligned with different codons in the corresponding human genomic DNA sequences ((Imamura 2004)).</annotation>

Repeat is ~180nuc long ((Krayev 1982)) but expressed B2 RNAs vary from ~0.2-0.6kb ((Kramerov 1982),(Fornace 1986)). 

The 5' of B2 SINE is derived from a tRNA ((Lawrence 1985), (Daniels 1985)) while the 3' contains an A rich sequence ((Krayev 1982)).

Transcribed by RNA polymerase III ((Krayev 1982), (Singh 1985)).</annotation>

Found in the nucleus ((Espinoza 2004)) and the cytoplasm ((Kramerov 1982)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">B2 SINE RNA is a specific inhibitor of RNA polymerase II ((Allen 2004)).

During heat shock B2 RNA associated with RNA polymerase II and repressed its action. Nb: Only saw association of B2 RNA with RNA polymerase II after heat shock. ((Allen 2004)).

Represses transcription by stably binding an RNA docking site on the core polymerase II complex and blocking activity of the RNA polymerase preinitiation complex ((Espinoza 2004)). To achieve this B2 RNA disrupts polymerase DNA binding at the promoter, preventing the formation of an active closed complex around the DNA ((Yakovchuk 2009)).

      <annotation section="Characteristics">Antisense transcript to Peg11/Rtl1. Peg11 is a retrotransposon-like protein coding gene ((Charlier 2001), (Byrne 2010)).

Reciprocal imprinting: antiPeg11 maternally expressed whereas Rtl1/Peg11 is paternally expressed. ((Charlier 2001), (Seitz 2003), (Hagan 2009)).

antiPeg11 contains 5 maternally expressed miRNAs (4 found in mammals, 1 specific to rodents, 1 specific to non-rodents) ((Seitz 2003),	(Davis 2005)).

In humans these are mir-431, mir-433, mir-127, mir-432 and mir-136. </annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Peg11 is expressed in a number of tissues in mouse, while antiPeg11 expression is restricted mostly to embryos and adult brain. In brain it was expressed at a higher level than Peg11 ((Hagan 2009)).

antiPeg11 miRNAs have a similar expression profile to the full length transcript ((Davis 2005)).

      <annotation section="Characteristics">Originate from the intergenic spacers (IGS) that separate rRNA genes ((Rungger 1979), (Morgan 1983)).

Like rRNA genes, spacers also contain polymerase I promoters and the ~2kb from the spacer promoter to the rRNA gene promoter is transcribed ((Kuhn 1987)). These long lncRNAs must be processed to create the a shorter ~150-300 nt RNA sequence(s), pRNAs, from just upstream of the rRNA promoter that bind TIP5 (the large subunit of the chromatin remodeling complex NoRC) ((Mayer 2006)).

In human cells transcription runs from ~1kb upstream of the rRNA transcriptional start site to over 200bp into the gene ((Shiao 2009)). 
</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Nuclear localised ((Mayer 2006)).

Expression of IGS sequences is regulated by the cell cycle with expression up-regulated in mid-S phase. There are many rRNA repeats and only a subset these express IGS sequences ((Santoro 2009)).

Expression in human lung cancer cell lines was generally higher than in a non-transformed lung cell line, with a negative correlation between the intergenic nc-rRNA and the 45s rRNA precursor transcript ((Shiao 2009)). Investigation of intergenic nc-rRNA SNPs also identified one that correlated with lower expression of the intergenic nc-rRNA ((Shiao 2009)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Required for the nucleolar localization of NoRC and epigenetic control of the rDNA locus ((Mayer 2006)).

Details:
Conserved stem-loop structure binds to the TIP5 protein in the chromatin remodeling complex NoRC ((Mayer 2006), (Mayer 2008)). This binding is controlled by the acetylation state of TIP5, with IGS RNA binding the de-acetylated version TIP5 ((Zhou 2009)).
Required for nucleolar localization of NoRC, recruitment of NoRC to chromatin, and subsequent addition of repressive histone modifications and DNA methylation at the rRNA gene promoter ((Mayer 2006)). 
Without IGS RNA, NoRC regulation is lost and rRNA expression is increased ((Mayer 2006)). 

pRNAs processed by IGS sequences can function in-trans, suggesting they could silence the rRNA genes they originate from or other rRNA gene clusters ((Santoro 2009)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">Expressed IGS sequences are found in widely diverged species ie: Xenopus, Drosophila and mouse ((Rungger 1979), (Miller 1983), (Kuhn 1987)), but may not carry out the same function.

In mammals the functional IGS sequences are poorly conserved at the nucleotide level but fold into similar stem-loop secondary structures ((Mayer 2008)). </annotation>

RNAs associate with Male-specific lethal (MSL) proteins (components of the multi-protein complex DCC), directing the DCC to hundreds of sites along the X chromosome to promote histone acetylation and gene-specific activation.

      <annotation section="Characteristics">91 kb, unspliced; imprinted (paternally expressed), it is transcribed from intron 10 of the maternally expressed Kncq1 (KvLQT1) gene from a CpG island that is the imprinting control region (IC2) ((Smilinich 1999)). This imprinted region contains at least eight genes that are expressed exclusively or preferentially from the maternal allele ((Kanduri 2011)).</annotation>

Mouse RNA found to be highly unstable with a half-life &lt;2 hr in N2A (neuroblastoma) cells ((Clark 2012))</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Summary: Kcnq1ot1 has a role in the organization of a tissue/lineage-specific nuclear domain involved in epigenetic silencing of the Kcnq1 imprinting control region.


Genes imprinted by kcnq1ot1 include Kcnq1, Cdkn1c, Slc22a18 and Phlda2, which are ubiquitously imprinted and Cd81, Osbpl5, Tssc4, Tspan32 and Ascl2, which are only imprinted in placenta (reviewed in (Kanduri 2011). An expansion of the Kncq1ot1 imprinted domain to include splice variants of Th and Ins2 was recently described ((Jones 2011)). 

Kcnq1ot1 silences genes by coating chromatin and recruiting repressive chromatin remodeling complexes such as G9a, PRC1 and PRC2 ((Terranova 2008), (Pandey 2008), (Umlauf 2004), (Zhao 2010)) .

Kcnq1ot1 transcript has a modular structure, the silencing element (that mediates the epigenetic silencing and directs the imprinted locus to a heterochromatin environment in the perinucleolar region) appears to be a short &lt;1kb conserved sequence near the 5' of the transcript ((Mohammad 2008)).

Kcnq1ot1 forms a silenced subdomain ((Terranova 2008))((Redrup 2009)) commonly localised to the perinucleolar region during S phase ((Mohammad 2008)). The silenced subdomain may be important to the maintenance of transcriptional repression.

Kcnq1ot1 interacts with Dnmt1 and recruits it to somatically acquired differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of imprinted genes ((Mohammad 2010)).

In vivo knockout study shows that paternal inheritance of a deletion encompassing an 890-bp (Delta890) silencing domain downstream of the Kcnq1ot1 promoter leads reduced interaction with DNMT1 and to selective incomplete relaxation of the imprinting of imprinted genes in a tissue-specific manner ((Mohammad 2010)).

Delta890 showed altered DNA methylation at somatically acquired DMRs but not in histone modifications of the ubiquitously imprinted genes. Thus, it has been proposed that the ubiquitous and placental-specific imprinting of genes within the Kcnq1 domain might be mediated by distinct mechanisms, and Kcnq1ot1 RNA might mediate the silencing of ubiquitously imprinted genes by maintaining allele-specific methylation through its interactions with Dnmt1 ((Mohammad 2010)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">Patches of highly conserved repeats in 5' side of transcript, which contains the silencing domain ((Mohammad 2008)). Promoter control elements are highly conserved between mouse and humans, including CCAAT elements that are targets of NF-Y regulation ((Pandey 2004)), as well as the position of CpG islands in the imprinting control region ((Paulsen 2004)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Misc">(Syndromes and diseases associated, eg Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrom, and cancers (see references list):
Associated with multiple balanced chromosomal rearrangements in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and an additional break-point in embryonal rhabdoid tumours; in particular, aberrant methylation of the CpG island associated with Kcnq1ot1 promoter is strongly associated with cancer risk and specific birth defects in BWS ((Smilinich 1999))).

Thought to block PKR activity, avoiding phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha and inhibition of viral mRNA translation ((Thimmappaya 1982)). PKR-binding secondary structure domain can adopt different conformations, which are functionally non-equivalent and exist in a mixed population ((Wahid 2009)). 

Recently, it has been shown that VA1 has an important role in suppressing the RNAi response in infected cells during viral replication ((Andersson 2005), (McKenna 2006), (Sano 2006), (Xu 2007)). Processed by Dicer into small RNAs that are incorporated into RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex). Approximately 80% of Ago2-containing RISC immunopurified from late-infected cells are associated with VA RNA-derived small RNAs (mivaRNAs), processed from the 3' strand of the terminal stems of the VA RNAs ((Xu 2007)). Nevertheless, VAII seems to be the preferred substrate for Dicer, accounting for approximately 60% of all small RNAs loaded in RISC ((Xu 2007)).

A deletion study shows that VAI may perform the role of bi-functional RNA by being processed by Dicer at the terminal stem to saturate the RNAi system, while generating a shortened VAI RNA that remains active to inhibit PKR. An RNA mutant that lacked the entire terminal stem was still able to bind PKR and inhibit its activity ((Wahid 2008)).

A fraction of the VAII-derived mivaRNAs are associated with polyribosomes, indicating a possible role in regulating translation of cellular mRNAs ((Xu 2007)).</annotation>

A Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) study indicates that dutA is the most abundant polyadenylated RNA in the Dictyostelium transcriptome, expressed at a level almost twice that of the next highest gene ((Whitney 2010)).

      <annotation section="Function">Identified in a shRNA knock down screening for conserved long noncoding RNAs that modulate the activity of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT).

Knockdown of human or mouse NRON sequences in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells or mouse 3T3 and Jurkat cell lines resulted in significantly increased NFAT activity.

Knockdown of NRON increases NFAT transcription factor activity by specifically affecting NFAT nuclear trafficking. This effect is observed on the activity of multiple NFAT family members (NFATc1, NFATc2, NFATc3, and NFATc4).

Using an RNA-protein affinity purification strategy with part of NRON sequence, 11 proteins were reported to putatively bind NRON. These included: calmodulin-binding protein (IQGAP1), a nuclear transport factor (KPNB1), the structural subunit of a phosphatase (PPP2R1A), a component of the proteasome (PSMD11) and an RNA helicase (DDX3X); as well as three members of the importin-beta superfamily, factors which mediate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of cargoes such as NFAT. Direct interaction was demonstrated with importin-beta 1 (KPNB1).

In summary, having a repressive effect on NFAT signaling, NRON is proposed to regulate NFAT's subcellular localization as an RNA component of a protein complex that acts to represses NFAT activity.
It has presumed implications in immune response and developmental processes regulated by NFAT.</annotation>

Expressed on opposite strand to FLO11. Starts within a region covered by a second lncRNA ICR1, transcribed in antisense direction to ICR1 and terminates around the area of ICR1 initiation.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Expression of ICR1 and PWR1 is inversely correlated. 

ICR1 expression requires the Sfl1 transcription factor known to repress FLO11 and is repressed by the Flo8 transcription factor and the Rpd3L histone deacetylase (HDAC).

PWR1 expression requires Rpd3L HDAC and Flo8 and is repressed by Sfl1.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">PWR1 regulates expression of the FLO11/MUC1 gene in cis, in conjunction with a second lncRNA ICR1.

Expression of ICR1 represses expression of FLO11, probably by promoter occlusion. 

Expression of ICR1 is repressed by PWR1 (again probably by promoter occlusion in cis), allowing expression of FLO11, so the regulatory circuit depends on whether PWR1 is expressed or repressed.

ICR1 is lowly expressed constitutively and competition between Flo8 and Sfl1 transcription factors determines which ncRNA is expressed and therefore if FLO11 is on or off.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Misc">FLO11/ MUC1 - cell surface glycoprotein that controls cell-cell adhesion and shows variegated expression in a clonal population of yeast cells (ie: expressed at high levels in some cells, silenced in others).

      <annotation section="Characteristics">Bifunctional gene, active as an RNA and encodes a conserved protein SRAP (reviewed in (Leygue 2007)).

SRA has a large number of isoforms, most of which share a central core region. Only some isoforms are also able to encode the SRAP protein, and differential splicing may be one mechanism of generating coding and noncoding isoforms of SRA ((Hube 2006)) (reviewed in (Leygue 2007)).

A number of functional motifs, with predicted secondary structures, are required for SRA RNA function ((Lanz 2002)). </annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Expressed in a wide range of tissues, some isoforms appear to have tissue specific expression ((Lanz 1999), (Lanz 2003)).

Up-regulated in tumours of steroid hormone responsive tissues ie: breast, uterus and ovary compared to matched normal tissue ((Murphy 2000), (Lanz 2003)).

Found in the nucleus and the cytoplasm ((Lanz 2003), (Zhao 2006)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Forms ribonucleoprotein complexes with a number of nuclear receptors (including many steroid hormone receptors) generally acting to stimulate transcriptional activation ((Lanz 1999), (Leygue 2007)).

Interacts either directly or through a complex with a number of other co-activator and repressor proteins, such as SRC-1, Sharp, SLIRP and p68 and p72 RNA helicases. SRA has been suggested to act as a scaffold for these complexes (reviewed in (Leygue 2007)).

Transgenic expression of SRA in vivo caused hyperplasia and morphological abnormalities in steroid hormone responsive tissues. Hyperplasia was accompanied by higher apoptosis however and expression of SRA did not lead to tumourigenesis ((Lanz 2003)).

Associated with cardiomyopathy in humans, a role in heart development was validated in zebrafish but it's unclear if SRAP or SRA or both is responsible ((Friedrichs 2008)).

SRA activity is regulated by pseudouridylation ((Zhao 2004), (Zhao 2006)).</annotation>

Studies show SRAP can also regulate the activity of nuclear receptors and bind to promoter regions regulated by nuclear receptors, suggesting functional similarities between SRA RNA and SRAP ((Chooniedass-Kothari 2010), (Chooniedass-Kothari 2010)).

Multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN1). Short isoform - MEN epsilon. Long isoform - MEN beta. 

VINC:  Virus-inducible ncRNA</annotation>
      <annotation section="Characteristics">Two isoforms: ~3.7 (NEAT1 v1/ MEN epsilon) and ~23 kb (NEAT1 v2/ MEN beta) transcribed from the MEN1 locus ((Guru 1997), (Saha 2006), (Hutchinson 2007), (Sunwoo 2008)).

Intergenic, single exon transcript. One transcriptional start site, long isoform is a continuation of the short isoform ((Hutchinson 2007)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Expressed in a wide range of human and mouse tissues ((Peyman 1998), (Saha 2006), (Hutchinson 2007), (Sunwoo 2008)). Although expression of the long isoform (Neat1 v2/ Men beta) is much lower than Neat1 v1/ Men epsilon in many tissues ((Nakagawa 2011)).

Up-regulation of Neat1 (and subsequent formation of/increase in paraspeckles) may be a general feature of differentiation. Neat1 is up-regulated upon human ESC differentiation ((Chen 2009)), muscle differentiation ((Sunwoo 2008)) and in-vitro neuronal differentiation ((Mercer 2010)).

Up-regulated upon infection of mice with Japanese encephalitis virus or Rabies virus ((Saha 2006)).

Expressed in the nucleus accumbens of normal human brains and upregulated in this brain region in heroin abusers ((Michelhaugh 2010)). In addition, expression levels are elevated in the caudate nucleus of patients suffering from the neurodegenerative condition, Huntington's disease ((Johnson 2011)).

Localised to paraspeckles within the nucleus ((Hutchinson 2007), (Sunwoo 2008)).

Mouse Neat1 found to be highly unstable (half-life &lt;2 hr) in N2A (neuroblastoma) and 3T3 cells, although low stability did not prevent paraspeckle formation ((Friedel 2009), (Clark 2012)), while human NEAT1 appears to be more stable ((Friedel 2009), (Sasaki 2009), (Sunwoo 2008)). The two Neat1 isoforms also have differing stability, with the long (v2/Men beta) isoform more stable than than the shorter (v1/Men epsilon) isoform in N2A and 3T3 cells ((Clark 2012)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Transcription of Neat1 is essential for the assembly, maintenance and structural integrity of paraspeckles ((Clemson 2009), (Sasaki 2009), (Sunwoo 2008), (Mao 2010)).

Newly transcribed Neat1 RNA nucleates the formation of paraspeckles at its transcription site, recruiting paraspeckle proteins. Continued expression is required to maintain paraspeckles, identifying the dynamic nature of this nuclear body ((Mao 2010)).
Literature currently provides conflicting evidence about whether Neat1 v1 is sufficient for the formation of paraspeckles, or if this requires full length Neat1 v2 ((Sasaki 2009), ((Shevtsov 2011)). In vivo however, significant expression of Neat1 v2 appears to be required for cells to form more than 1 or 2 paraspeckles ((Nakagawa 2011)).

Neat1 appears to constrain the size and mediate the cylindrical geometry of paraspeckles. Neat1 short and the identical 5' end of Neat1 long plus the 3' of Neat1 long all localise to the periphery of paraspeckles, while the central region of Neat1 long is found in the interior of the nuclear body ((Souquere 2010)).

Interacts with paraspeckles proteins PSPC1, PSF/SFPQ and NONO/P54NRB either directly or in a complex ((Clemson 2009), (Sasaki 2009), (Sunwoo 2008)).

Interaction of short isoform with p54 requires protein interaction regions near the 5' and 3' of the transcript ((Murthy 2010)).

Neat1 knockout lead to loss of paraspeckles, however mice were viable and fertile with normal morphology and populations of differentiated cells in one Neat1 v1 and v2 expressing tissue tested ((Nakagawa 2011)).

Neat1 has also been reported to interact with a number of chromatin binding protein/complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells including PRC1, PRC2,	JARID1B, ESET	and SUV39H1, with the general pattern being interaction with repressors of gene expression ((Guttman 2011))</annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">Placental mammals. Dog Neat1 is found in several genomic locations, version that is found near single dog Malat1 gene is given below ((Hutchinson 2007)). </annotation>
      <annotation section="Misc">A conserved tRNA like sequence at the 3' end is cleaved off and processed to generate a short tRNA-like ncRNA from the long (Men beta) transcript, similar to Malat1 ((Sunwoo 2008)).

The last ~500bp of the short (Men epsilon) isoform has been shown to be expressed in trophoblast cells with a function potentially independent from the Neat1 transcript. This transcript, TncRNA has its own entry.</annotation>

      <annotation section="Expression">SRG1 is expressed under growth conditions where SER3 is not expressed ((Martens 2004)).

SRG1 expression is regulated by serine levels ((Martens 2005)).

Despite being identified as cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) ((Davis 2006)), SRG1 transcripts were predominately degraded in the cytoplasm not the nuclear exosome. ((Thompson 2006)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">SRG1 inhibits transcription of SER3 by transcriptional interference, as the process of SRG1 transcription through the SER3 promoter prevents transcription factor binding to this locus ((Martens 2004)). SRG1 transcription does not appear to be sufficient for repression with proper chromatin remodeling also required ((Davis 2006)). 

SER3 is an enzyme involved in serine biosynthesis, whose expression is regulated by the level of serine. Serine level controlled the expression of SRG1, with SRG1 transcribed when serine is present and repressed when it is not. This regulation depended on Cha4, a serine dependent regulator, which binds the SRG1 promoter. When serine is high Cha4 appears to recruit the SAGA and Swi/Snf complexes to SRG1 promoter to activate SRG1 expression and repress SER3 ((Martens 2005)).</annotation>

      <annotation section="Name">Brain Cytoplasmic RNA 1</annotation>
      <annotation section="Characteristics">152 nt; evolved from a tRNA Ala ((DeChiara 1987)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Expressed by a specific subset of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system; localises to dendrites ((Tiedge 1991)), or both axons and dendrites ((Muslimov 2002), (Centonze 2007)) in different subsets of neurons and in a developmentally regulated manner. 

Decreased expression in brains of mice that suffer chronic epileptic seizures (GitaÃ­ (2011)).

Also expressed in germ cells ((Muslimov 2002)).

Dendritic localisation mediated by an extended stem loop element ((Rozhdestvensky 2001)) in 5' 62 nucleotides ((Muslimov 1997)), containing two targeting codes a stem bulge motif that specifies nuclear export and a GA kink-turn (KT) motif that binds heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 and mediates transport to the distal ends of dendrites ((Muslimov 2006)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Summary: Functions to regulate localised translation at dendrites, controlling neuron excitability and place learning. Lack of BC1 causes a susceptibility to epileptic seizures. 


Binds eIF4A, eIF4B and PABP to repress translation initiation by blocking assembly of the 48S initiation complex ((Wang 2002), (Muddashetty 2002), (Wang 2005), (Kondrashov 2005), (Lin 2008)).

Translational repression is mediated by its 3' domain and A rich region ((Muddashetty 2002), (Wang 2005), (Kondrashov 2005)).

Inhibits eukaryotic initiation factor 4A helicase by uncoupling ATPase activity from helicase/ duplex unwinding activity ((Lin 2008)).

By regulating localised translation BC1 can control neuron excitability; 
ie: by regulating dopamine receptor levels and dopamine signalling in the striatum ((Centonze 2007)) 
ie: inhibiting translation activation from metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) signalling ((Zhong 2009)). 


Knock-out of BC1 in mouse affected exploratory behaviour and anxiety, leading to higher mortality in field experiments  ((Skryabin 2003), (Lewejohann 2004)).

Brain phenotypes of BC1 knockout mice include neuronal hyperexcitability triggered by mGluR signaling or GABAa receptor stimulation which stimulates protein translation BC1 would act to repress ((Zhong 2009), (Zhong 2010)). Epileptogenic susceptibility (epileptic activity and convulsive seizures) upon auditory stimulation ((Zhong 2009), (Zhong 2010)) and defects in place learning ((Zhong 2010)). 

The combination of BC1 and fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) knockouts causes neuronal excitability, epileptogenesis, and place learning deficits of increased severity than individual knockouts suggesting BC1 and FMRP act independently to repress translation ((Zhong 2010)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">Evolved from a tRNA Ala ((DeChiara 1987)).

Rodent specific ((Martignetti 1993)).

BC1, BC200 and G22 likely form a family of independently exapted repetitive elements which have evolved to carry out similar functions in different mammalian species ((Muddashetty 2002), (Khanam 2006), (Lin 2008)). </annotation>

CTCF protein acts to repress transcription of the lysozyme gene.

Repression of LINoCR expression prevented eviction of CTCF from the -2.4kb element as well as histone modifications of this site and positioning of a nucelosome over the CTCF binding site. This demonstrated that LINoCR expression was necessary for CTCF eviction.

      <annotation section="Characteristics">~3.15kb capped and polyadenylated single exon transcript.

Expressed in FLO11 regulatory region.

ICR1 has variable start and termination sites. Begins between ~3.2 and 3.4kb upstream of FLO11, runs towards FLO11 in sense direction, some transcripts stop before FLO11 while others can overlap the 5' of the PTC gene.

A second 1.2kb lncRNA PWR1 is expressed antisense to ICR1.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Expression of ICR1 and PWR1 is inversely correlated. 

ICR1 expression requires the Sfl1 transcription factor, which is known to repress FLO11, and is repressed by the Flo8 transcription factor and the Rpd3L HDAC protein.

PWR1 expression requires Rpd3L and Flo8 and is repressed by Sfl1.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">ICR1 regulates expression of the FLO11/MUC1 gene in cis, in conjunction with a second lncRNA PWR1.

Expression of ICR1 represses expression of FLO11, probably by promoter occlusion. 

Expression of ICR1 is repressed by PWR1 (again probably by promoter occlusion in-cis), allowing expression of FLO11, so the regulatory circuit depends on whether PWR1 is expressed or repressed.

ICR1 is lowly expressed constitutively and competition between Flo8 and Sfl1 transcription factors determines which ncRNA is expressed and therefore if FLO11 is on or off.</annotation>

      <annotation section="Function">SUT719 is required for complete switching off of SUR7 expression (disruption of SUT719 expression allows SUR7 expression after stimulation with alpha-factor pheromone when it would normally not be expressed).

SUT719 acts to fine tune gene expression by impacting the on/off threshold of SUR7. When SUR7 is expressed at low levels it is inhibited by SUT719, but high level SUR7 gene expression is not affected by SUT719.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Misc">Regulation of GAL80 gene expression also affects SUT719, as they both come from a bidirectional promoter. In turn, SUT719 can regulate the expression of SUR7.

      <annotation section="Expression">Expression induced during myoblast differentiation but absent in proliferating myoblasts in mouse and humans.

In mouse tissues expression was restricted to certain skeletal muscles where it was found only in &quot;newly regenerating fibres&quot;. Expression is found more widely found amongst skeletal muscle of mutant mice which do not express dystrophin. 

Conversely in myoblasts from humans with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), there was little linc-MD1 expression and MYOG and MHC expression was also reduced.  

Predominately cytoplasmic.

Promoter regions near the linc-MD1 and miR-206 TSSs contain conserved CANNTG (E-box) sequences, and are bound by the muscle transcription factor MyoD. During myoblast differentiation and in muscles where linc-MD1 is expressed these promoter regions (plus others) form long distance chromatin interactions.</annotation>

Nb: These linc-MD1 effects were also observed when linc-MD1 was mutated so miR-133b could not be released from the sequence, showing this effect was due to the lincRNA transcript. </annotation>

Antisense RNA is reported to map in two different genomic regions, and also to contain a potential ORF, potentially representing the FAM103A1 pseudogene.

Pair are proposed to be reciprocally regulated, and antisense RPS6KA2 is hypothesized to regulate RPS6KA2 expression in cancer. Over-expression of the antisense RNA in BT20 cells (a breast cancer cell line model) was associated with a decrease in the intracellular levels of the sense transcript, whereas knock-down of RPS6KA2 sense by RNAi in the BT20 cell line caused an increase in the level of RPS6KA2 antisense.</annotation>

Transcripts of various sizes are detected by Northern blot, including a major band of ~5kb, but also bands of ~9 and ~11kb, depending on the tissue analysed ((Harrigan 1989), (Keshet 1980)). </annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">VL30 RNAs are found ubiquitously in adult mice tissues ((Harrigan 1989)). VL30-1 RNA (a member of the VL30 family) is expressed 5- to 8-fold higher in mouse tumor lines than in mouse fibroblast or myoblast lines ((Wang 2009)), and is induced by pituitary hormones in steroidogenic cells ((Song 2004)).

Identified in the developing mouse periventricular germinal zones. It is also expressed extensively in the developing mouse CNS. Enriched in undifferentiated neurospheres derived from cortex in bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) and TGFa (transforming growth factor alpha), as well as from striatum in bFGF, compared to differentiated cortical neurospheres derived in bFGF. Also found expressed in both Embryonic Stem (ES) cells and Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSC) ((Easterday 2003)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">VL30-1 binds and regulates the PSF (PTB-associated splicing factor) protein, which contains 2 RNA-binding domains (RBDs), forming a PSF-RNA complex ((Wang 2009)).

VL30 RNA regulates steroidogenesis, and possibly other physiological processes, by forming a complex with PSF in mice ((Song 2004)).

Ectopic expression of VL30-1 RNA in a human tumor cell promoted metastasis ((Song 2002)), and in mice over-expression of VL30-1 RNA promoted cell proliferation in culture and tumorigenesis in-vivo ((Wang 2009)).

VL30-1 RNA is tumor-promoting whereas PSF is a tumor-suppressor agent, and the molar ratio of PSF protein and VL30-1 RNA regulates proto-oncogene transcription, cell proliferation, and tumorigenesis. VL30-1 RNA binds and releases PSF from a proto-oncogene and activates transcription of target genes ((Song 2005)). For example, in mice VL30-1 RNA has been shown to bind and release PSF from the proto-oncogene Rab23, activating its transcription in-trans ((Wang 2009)). (Although VL30 RNAs are not present in the human genome, a similar regulatory mechanism functions in human cells, in which different RNA fragments bind PSF ((Li 2009)).)

VL30 is enriched in multiple stem cell populations and may have roles in determining  &quot;stemness&quot;, or stem cell function ((Easterday 2003)).</annotation>

      <annotation section="Characteristics">MUNC, first known as DDR(eRNA), was using genome-wide binding profile (Polllm ChIP, MyoD Chip and DNase1 sensitivity). MUNC was first described as RNA transcribed from extragenic enchaner regions of MYOD1 (Mousavi 2013) .MUNC is encoded 5 kb upstream of the transcription start site of MyoD, a myogenic transcription factor gene (Mueller 2014) . Although MUNC overlaps with the DRR enhancer, our results suggest that MUNC is not a classic cis-acting enhancer RNA (e-RNA) acting exclusively by stimulating the neighboring MyoD gene but more like a promyogenic lncRNA that acts directly or indirectly on multiple promoters to increase myogenic gene expression (Mueller 2014)</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">MUNC is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle, exists as an unspliced and spliced isoform (Mueller 2014). Upregulated more than ten-fold in myotubes versus myoblasts (Mueller 2014) .

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) of MUNC reduced myoblast differentiation and specifically reduced the association of MyoD to the DRR enhancer and myogenin promoter but not to another MyoD-dependent enhancer (Mueller 2014)

Stable overexpression of MUNC from a heterologous promoter increased endogenous MyoD, Myogenin, and Myh3 (myosin heavy chain, [MHC] gene) mRNAs but not the cognate proteins, suggesting that MUNC can act in trans to promote gene expression but that this activity does not require an induction of MyoD protein. MUNC also stimulates the transcription of other genes that are not recognized as MyoD-inducible genes. Knockdown of MUNC in vivo impaired murine muscle regeneration, implicating MUNC in primary satellite cell differentiation in the animal. We also discovered a human MUNC that is induced during differentiation of myoblasts and whose knockdown decreases differentiation, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role of MUNC lncRNA in myogenesis (Mueller 2014)</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Overexpression and knock out experiment suggest that MUNC is involved in murine muscle regeneration and differentiation of myoblasts (Mueller 2014).

      <annotation section="Characteristics">LncRNA from the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted region ((Komine 1999), (Royo 2007)).

Similar to Rian locus in mouse and humans with a lncRNA containing intronic snoRNAs, except the Bsr locus contains a ~100kb rat specific sequence containing 86 0.9kb tandem repeats ((Royo 2007), (Komine 1999)).  Bsr appears to have evolved through a massive duplication based expansion of some snoRNAs present in the ancestral locus ((Royo 2007)). 

Tandem repeats in the Bsr locus consist of an intron containing the RBII-36 snoRNA and a Bsr lncRNA exon ((CavaillA 2001), (Royo 2007)).

Multiple products are detected from the Bsr locus consisting of varying numbers of the 0.9kb tandem repeat from which the ~75 bp snoRNA is spliced out ((Komine 1999), (CavaillA 2001)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Imprinted: Maternally expressed ((Royo 2007)). Like snoRD115-HG and snoRD116-HG, one Bsr allele can show evidence of less compacted chromatin, this is almost always the transcribed allele ((Vitali 2009)).

Bsr is expressed predominantly in the CNS both during development and in adults ((Komine 1999)) as is the RBII-36 snoRNA cluster ((CavaillA 2001)).

Nuclear localisation ((Komine 1999)). Mature, spliced Bsr was not localised to the nucleolus, unlike most mature RBII-36 ((CavaillA 2001), (Royo 2007)). Bsr was present as mutiple small foci in the interchromatin space, often found on periphery of SC35 speckles but not found in SC35 speckles or paraspeckles ((Royo 2007)). Did not co-localise with rat snoRD115-HG or snoRD116-HG, two other nuclear retained snoRNA containing lncRNAs ((Vitali 2009)). 

Upon cellular stress a portion of Bsr relocates to the cytoplasm where it associates with stress granules ((Royo 2007)).
</annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">Bsr and Rian/MEG8/Irm are not highly conserved between species ((CavaillA 2002)). However, some Rian exons show good homology to Bsr and while many snoRNAs are specific to one species others are homologous ((Hatada 2001), (CavaillA 2002)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Misc">UCSC browser link is from mapping of mouse Rian/Meg8 onto rat and may not be precisely representative of full length Bsr, the sequence for which is not available.</annotation>

The snoRNAs vary between species, but there are some homologous snoRNAs between each suggesting an evolutionary history with species specific snoRNA addition and duplication ((CavaillA 2002)).
The expression profiles of Bsr, Rian/Irm/MEG8 and the snoRNAs they contain are similar between rat, human and mouse.</annotation>

      <annotation section="Characteristics">Three CARMEN isoforms have been annotated - CARMEN1, CARMEN2, and CARMEN3

Found to be a human super enhancer-associated long noncoding RNA controlling cardiac specification differentiation and homeostasis (Ounzain 2015).

Found upstream of MIR-143 and -145 which are two important developmental miRNAs implicated in cardiac precursor specification and differentiation []. This region was shown to harbor a cardiac SRF/NKX2.5-bound enhancer required for cardiac-specific expression of miR-143 and -145 during cardiac development  (Xu 2009)

CARMEN is found in a locus encompassed a cardiac super enhancer (Ounzain 2015)

ChIP-analysis demonstrates that these transcripts mapped to a highly active cardiac enhancer (P300) in both fetal and adult human hearts (Ounzain 2015)</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">CARMEN1, CARMEN2 and CARMEN3, are found to be at relatively high levels and significantly induced in differentiating fetal cardiac precursor cells (Ounzain 2015)

Expression of CARMEN observed to be negatively correlated to expression of cardiac-specific miR-143 and -145 in differentiating fetal cardiac precursor cells (Ounzain 2015).

In a murine model which uses mouse embryonic stem cells to recapitulates embryonic cardiac development in vitro,  Carmen was found to be induced between the cardiac mesoderm and  cardiac precursor  stages with maximal expression occurring in  cardiac precursor. The expression of CARMEN in differentiated cardiomyocytes of  the murine model was comparable to the expression in differentiated cardiomyocytes derived from adult mouse heart. The role of CARMEN in cardiac differentiation was also observed in P19CL6 cells (Ounzain 2015)

Carmen expression correlated with enhancer activity high H3K27Ac occupancy levels during cardiac differentiation with maximal enhancer activity  occurred between the MES and CPC stages (Ounzain 2015)

Carmen was significantly upregulated post myocardial infarction ( Fig. 8A), supporting a role for Carmen in adult heart homeostasis and cardiac remodeling (Ounzain 2015).

Deregulated expression CARMEN has also been shown in two human heart pathologies, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and aortic stenosis (AOS) (Ounzain 2015).
Expression of all three human CARMEN isoforms. CARMEN3 was significantly upregulated in both DCM and AOS whereas CARMEN1 and 2 were only induced in AOS patients  (Ounzain 2015) 

CARMEN3 expression was markedly higher in post mortem atrium and ventricle heart tissues. CARMEN3. Hypertensive patients demonstrated increased expression of CARM in atria while levels in ventricles was not significantly different (Ounzain 2015)</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Relative high expression level in fetal cardiac precursor cells suggest the role of CARMEN in cardiac specification and differentiation (Ounzain 2015)

Cardiogenesis differentiation in P19CL6 cells was blocked when cells are transfected with shRNAi targeting CARMEN. Knockdown of CARMEN expression also resulted in silencing some known cardiogenic regulator including  Braveheart (bvht) lncRNA and Mesp1. Consequently, their downstream cardiac TFs Gata4 and Islet1, and the CM-specific genes Myl2, Myh6 were severely inhibited Oct4, Nanog and Emoes expression was also affected by CARMEN knockdown  (Ounzain 2015).


In human fetal CPC, antisense-GapmeRs known down of CARMEN resulted in ablation gene expression of cardiac transcription factors and differentiation markers, including GATA4, NKX2.5, TBX5, MYH6, MYH7, and TNNI  (Ounzain 2015). CARMEN depletion was associated with decreased expression of the smooth muscle cell marker, MYH11  (Ounzain 2015).. Importantly, CARMEN depletion was not associated with decreased expression of miR-143 and -145, further supporting the notion that CARMEN isoforms are not the precursor transcripts for these miRNAs  (Ounzain 2015).. Consequently, CARMEN silencing impaired the capacity of human CPCs to produce differentiated cardiomyocytes., CARMEN-depleted cells were also co-transfected with MIR-143 and MIR-145 mimics were not able to restore cardiogenic differentiation induced by CARMEN knockdown (Ounzain 2015).

Thr cis-acting function of CARMEN was exhibited by the use of a firefly luciferase reporter gene under the control of a basal SV40 promoter inserted downstream of the CARMEN expression cassette (Ounzain 2015).

CARMEN was detected  in RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays with antibodies specific to EZH2 and SUZ12, suggesting that Carmen may have trans-repressive roles during cardiac differentiation  (Ounzain 2015).</annotation>

      <annotation section="Name">snaR: small NF90-associated RNAs</annotation>
      <annotation section="Characteristics">~117nt. RNA polymerase III transcripts. Highly structured. snaR genes shares sequence identity with Alu RNA and two potential piRNAs. Cloned snaR sequences have a run of adenines in the 3' end followed by a run of thymidines (which presumably constitute the PolIII termination site) ((Parrott 2007)).

snaR-A and snaR-B were originally identified associated to the Nuclear factor 90 (NF90) (a double-stranded RNA-binding protein implicated in multiple cellular functions) by in vivo cross-linking followed by immunoprecipitation.RNA species immunoprecipitated with NF90 were ~80-120 nt long ((Parrott 2007)). Several related RNAs of ~104 nt were originally cloned and identified, with snaR-A being the major component, and snaR-B representing the minor subset.  snaR-A and snaR-B are ~90% identical in sequence. Human genomic sequences corresponding to snaR-A and snaR-B have occasional mismatches (suggested to be possibly due to C-to-U editing of the RNA).

snaR genes occur in multiple copies (accumulated by segmental duplication) arranged in two inverted regions of tandem repeats on human chromosome 19. Additional snaR gene copies are present, with two of them adjacent to genes encoding the beta chain of chorionic gonadotropin:

In total, 28 snaR genes have been identified in the human genome, including 14 genes for snaR-A and 2 genes for snaR-B. snaR genes identified by sequence analysis include 5 snaR-C genes and additional genes (snaR-D, -E, -F, -G1, -G2, -H, -I, -12 and -21) ((Parrott 2007)). snaR-D to -G include 5 unique genes on chromosome 19 as well as single copies (snaR-2 and -3) on chromosomes 2 and 3. snaR-G1 and -G2 are located in a gene-rich 2.1 Mb genomic fragment between the two clusters, lying within the promoter region of two genes encoding the beta polypeptide of chorionic gonadotropin (CG-beta) ((Parrott 2007)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Predominantly cytoplasmic, unstable (half-life of ~15 min in HeLa cells), expressed in diverse cell lines and human tissues. The different snaR genes have different expression levels and profiles, and, among more than 20 adult human tissues analysed, snaR transcripts are found particularly abundant in testis, with low levels detected in brain, placenta and some other organs. ((Parrott 2007), (Parrott 2010)).

Highly abundant in some cells, with snaR-A estimated in ~70,000 copies in a HEK293T cell ((Parrott 2007)).

snaR-A and snaR-G2 are differentially expressed in discrete regions of the human brain and other tissues, such as testis ((Parrott 2010)). snaR-A was expression n testis was ~100-fold higher than in term placenta, lung and adipose tissue, and in brain its levels were ~10% of the testis level in three of four segments of pituitary gland, with substantial expression also observed in other brain regions (such as hypothalamus, globus pallidus and thalamus) ((Parrott 2010)). snaR-G2 levels in adult brain were ~55% of that in testis (highest in caudate/accumbens/putamen and globus pallidus), and several tissues displayed 5-15% of testis levels. Fetal brain contained much less snaR-G2 than adult brain (~3% of testis level), suggestive of developmental regulation. ((Parrott 2010))

snaR-A is up-regulated in transformed and immortalized human cells (Parrott et al. 2010).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Functions of snaR transcripts have not been identified yet.

snaR transcripts interact with NF90's double-stranded RNA-binding motifs (dsRBMs) ((Parrott 2007)), and snaR-A is also found stably bound to ribosomes in HeLa cells (Parrott et al. 2010).

Suggested to be involved in tissue- and species-specific regulation of cell growth and translation ((Parrott 2007), (Parrott 2009), (Parrott 2010)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Conservation">snaR genes are present exclusively in African Great Apes and some are unique to humans. Human snaR-A has orthologs in chimpanzee but not rhesus macaque or mouse. Chimpanzee has fewer snaR genes than humans (10 instead of 28). snaRs appear to have undergone accelerated evolution (snaR genes display a lower degree of homology within the gene than in their flanking sequence) and differential expansion in the great apes.  ((Parrott 2007), Parrott et al. 2010). There are ~17 nt changes between human snaR-A (121nt) and snaR-C  (119nt) species (~14% difference), compared to an average substitution rate of ~3.7?nt per 120nt (~3% difference) outside of the snaR locus ((Parrott 2010)).

The single snaR gene on chimpanzee chromosome 2a is 94% identical with its ortholog on human chromosome 2, and two genes on chimpanzee chromosome 19 are orthologous with snaR-G1 (a unique gene on human chromosome 19). The position of these snaR genes relative to the primate-specific CG-beta genes is conserved. ((Parrott 2007))</annotation>
      <annotation section="Misc">*Two families of snaR-related genetic elements were identified in primates: CAS (catarrhine ancestor of snaR), limited to Old World Monkeys and apes; and ASR  (Alu/snaR-related), present in all monkeys and apes. These two classes appear to have spread by retrotransposition.
It has been proposed that snaR genes evolved through a series of internal deletions and expansions  from the left monomer of the primate-specific Alu SINE family via ASR and CAS ((Parrott 2010)).

*Short RNAs of ~26-34 nt can be detected after long exposure of Northern blots with snaR probes ((Parrott 2007)).

*Other RNAs are also found associated with NF90, including viral RNAs, such as the VAI and VAII noncoding RNAs from human adenoviruses ((Liao 1998)).</annotation>

At interphase alpha-centromeric RNA is localised to the nucleolus. It is able to bind multiple centromeric proteins (CENPC1 and INCENP), which it sequesters in this subdomain. 

CENPC1, a core kinetochore protein, appears to bind directly to alpha-satellite RNA.

Upon mitosis alpha-centromeric RNA re-localises to chromosomal centromeres, allowing localisation of CENPC1, INCENP and survivin (an INCENP-interacting protein) to the metaphase centromere and assembly of the kinetochore.

Dali binding sites were typically limited to less than 1 kb in length with even distribution across the genome with the exception of depletion on the X chromsome , indicative of x-link inactivation in female N2A cells (Chalei 2014)</annotation>

Riboprobe Northern blot indicates the existence of three additional Emx2os splicing isoforms differentially detected in the murine urogenital system, with sizes of 6.0, 2,3 and 1,8 kb, which are supported by cDNA evidence ((Noonan 2003)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">EMX2 and EMX2OS and their murine orthologs have similar profiles and extensively coincident cellular expression patterns in the endometrium. Expressed in the uterus, abundant in normal postmenopausal endometrium, reduced in premenopausal endometrium ((Noonan 2003)).

Emx2os is expressed in the developing mouse CNS. Examination of expression at E10.5, E12.5, E14.5 and E18.5 showed, similar to Emx2, that its levels reduce progressively from E10.5 to E18.5. At E12.5, it is detected in a number of CNS structures also expressing Emx2 mRNA, such as the pallium and basal ganglia, mammillary recess of the hypothalamus, optic tectum, olfactory placode and otic vesicle. Emx2os is found in the developing telencephalon in periventricular proliferative layers and the cortical plate ((Spigoni 2010)).

However, the sense/antisense pair may also show mutually exclusive patterns, such as within the cortex. Emx2os is detected in periventricular precursors that also express Emx2, but peaks in newly born post-mitotic neurons, which do not express Emx2, whereas Emx2 is expressed Cajal-Retzius neurons lying in the marginal zone, which do not express the antisense RNA ((Spigoni 2010)).

      <annotation section="Function">EMX2OS is suggested to regulate EMX2 expression ((Noonan 2003)), which may involve distinct regulatory mechanisms in different cell types ((Spigoni 2010)).

In vitro knock-down experiments indicate that Emx2os contributes to post-transcriptional down-regulation of its sense partner in cortical precursors and their neuronal progenies, possibly by a Dicer1-dependent process  ((Spigoni 2010)).

However, ectopic expression of a 5' fragment (OS1-179+) of Emx2os in neural precursors of the rhombo-spinal tract stimulates expression of Emx2, indicating a complex regulatory mechanism, perhaps at transcriptional level. In addition, Emx2 knock-out results in a strong reduction of Emx2os transcript levels, indicating a possible reciprocal regulatory loop ((Spigoni 2010)).</annotation>

      <annotation section="Characteristics">The entire Vax2os locus spans ~19 kb on mouse genomic DNA and contains a sequence domain, of ~130 bases, localized within the Vax2os1 isoform, which is highly conserved across all mammalian genomes, including the rat, human, and other primates . This fragment represents the longest sequence conservation signature within the whole Vax2os transcriptional unit.</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Vax2os1 is a retina-specific lncRNA whose expression is restricted to the mouse ventral retina</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">spatiotemporal misexpression of Vax2os1 determines cell cycle alterations in photoreceptor progenitor cells. In particular, the overexpression of Vax2os1 in the developing early postnatal mouse retina causes an impaired cell cycle progression of photoreceptor progenitors toward their final committed fate and a consequent delay of their differentiation processes. At later developmental stages, this perturbation is accompanied by an increase of apoptotic events in the photoreceptor cell layer, in comparison with control retinas, without affecting the proper cell layering in the adult retina.Vax2os1 is involved in the control of cell cycle progression of photoreceptor progenitor cells in the ventral retina. </annotation>

      <annotation section="Characteristics ">Intergenic, ~9-10kb alternatively spliced transcript in mammals ((Ishii 2006), (Sone 2007)).

Contains tandem UACUAAC repeats, which match the conserved intron branch point sequence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ((Tsuiji 2011)).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Expression">Expressed predominantly in the nervous system ((Ishii 2006), (Sone 2007), (Mercer 2008), (Tsuiji 2011)).

Shows dynamic regulation during retinal development ((Blackshaw 2004)), differentiation of neural stem cells into oligodendrocytes ((Mercer 2010)) and in mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation ((Sheik Mohamed 2009))((Dinger 2008)). 

Expressed in the nucleus accumbens of normal human brains and one of a few genes up-regulated in this brain region in both cocaine and heroin abusers ((Albertson 2006), (Michelhaugh 2010)).

Nuclear specific localisation to novel nuclear matrix subdomain ((Sone 2007)).

Gomafu is downregulated in post-mortem cortical gray matter from the superior temporal gyrus in schizophrenia ((Barry 2013)). Dysregulation of Gomafu leads to alternative splicing patterns that resemble those observed in schizophrenia for the archetypal schizophrenia-associated genes DISC1 and ERBB4 ((Barry 2013))</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">Gomafu can bind the splicing factor 1 (SF1) protein through its UACUAAC repeat sequences. This sequence is a much stronger intron branch point sequence than found in most mammalian introns. In-vitro Gomafu binding to SF1 can inhibit splicing and spliceosomal complex formation suggesting Gomafu can function to regulate splicing efficiency ((Tsuiji 2011)).

Regulates retinal cell fate specification ((Rapicavoli 2010)).

Variants confer susceptibility to myocardial infarction, possibly through altering the RNA's protein binding properties ((Ishii 2006)).

      <annotation section="Features">Together with the noncoding RNA BC040587 and the tumor suppressor gene LSAMP (limbic system-associated membrane protein), LOC285194 is present in the focal region of chr3q13.31 (osteo3q13.31), which is the most altered region in osteosarcomas. These genes are proposed to be cooperatively acting tumor suppressors.

Recurrent focal copy-number changes and loss of heterozygosity (LOH), which usually involves loss of LOC285194 and BC040587 expression, implicate these ncRNAs in ostecosarcoma. Focal osteo3q13.31 CNAs and LOH are also common in cell lines from several other cancers (such as lung, autonomic and central nervous system, blood, endometrium, soft tissue, skin, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, and breast).

Depletion of LOC285194 by siRNA promoted proliferation of normal osteoblasts (with a mild increase in the G1 population) by cell-cycle transcripts (Cyclin D1, VEGF, and VEGFR1 up-regulation, and cyclin A2 and cyclin B1 suppression) as well as regulation of apoptotic genes (such as suppression of BCL2 and BimEL pro-apoptotic genes).

Genetic deletions of LOC285194 or BC040587 in  tumor DNA were also associated with dramatic decrease in survival of osteosarcoma patients.</annotation>

      <annotation section="Expression">The expression of lnc-DC increases with differentiation from monocyte to dendric cell, and the highest expression if found in conventional Dendric cells (Wang 2014).</annotation>
      <annotation section="Function">The transcription of lnc-DC in Dendric cells (DC) is associated with the transcription factor PU.1 that is involved in DC differentiation (Wang 2014). Knockdown of lnc-DC resulted in downregulation of DC associatted genes important for T cell activation while CD14, a mark for monocytes, was upregulated (Wang 2014). Knockdown impaired the cytokine production and the ability for T cell proliferation (Wang 2014). lnc-DC bind STAT3 in the cytoplasm and affects the phosphorylation by preventing dephosphorylation of Y705 by SHP1 (Wang 2014). The interaction between STAT3 and SHP1 is increased by lnc-DC knockdown and decrease by lnc-DC overexpression (Wang 2014).</annotation>
