Genes encoding long (>200nt) non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are preferably named based on the known function of the transcript, e.g. XIST. Antisense transcripts are named using the approved HGNC symbol for the protein-coding gene with the suffix 'AS' for 'antisense' (the gene symbol should not be the protein-coding gene symbol written backwards), intronic transcripts are appended with 'IT', and overlapping transcripts with 'OT'. Intergenic lncRNA genes are provided with a LINC name for 'long intergenic non-protein coding RNA, e.g. LINC00028. A short guide to lncRNA gene nomenclature was published in 2014, see http://www.humgenomics.com/content/8/1/7)

chromatin silencing complex
process: chromatin silencing, is_a chromatin organization 

forming chromatin-modifiying complexes
acting as transcriptional co-activators,
mediating chromatin-looping by enhancer-derived lncRNAs
the functioning as natural antisense transcripts
Modulation of transcription of oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes is an oncology-related function of lncRNAs (25).
Post-transcriptional functions of lncRNAs can trigger alternative splicing by pairing with other RNAs

LncRNAs often associate with the polycomb repressive complexes (PRC1
and PRC2) and histone methyltransferase G9a to introduce
post-translational modifications to specific amino acids in histone
tails, resulting in negative regulation of RNA pol II.

PRC1 is a multiprotein complex composed of proteins such as BMI1, RING1, RING2 and chromobox proteins (CBX) and is able to ubiquitinylate histone H2A at lysine 119 (26, 27).
PRC2 is assembled by EED, SUZ12 and histone methyltransferase EZH2 which trimethylates histone 3 lysine 27 (26, 27).
G9a introduces a repressive mark by trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (28).
- modulation of nucleosome positioning to regulate expression of genes.
  --- An example is the SWI/SNF complex which mediates restructuring of chromatin based on hydrolysis of ATP (29).



RNA-protein, RNA-RNA and RNA-DNA interactions can be combined by a single lncRNA to build distinct functionality conferring complexes

Significant deregulation in comparison to corresponding normal tissues was noted indicating tumor and lineage specific alterations, copy number changes, epigenetic modifications such as promoter methylation and cancer-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms
